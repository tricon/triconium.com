		<p>Well that was a fun little experiment. I want to use this space as a place for my thoughts and interests. However, simply snipping articles and reposting them really serves no purpose.

<p>I still may repost interesting video clips, comics, and images, but those are suitable to the Posterous format.</p>

		<div>I wanted to post some thoughts I had on the Courier from a conversation I had with&nbsp;<a href="http://lukeslens.posterous.com">Luke Boyce</a>.</div>
<div>
<hr />
</div>
<p>Microsoft employs some very bright people in their labs. These people come up with very clever solutions such as Photosynth, Seadragon, Surface; however, the implementation of these solutions and Microsoft&#8217;s overall vision tends to lack even as these fantastic concepts are implemented. This video is also incredibly pre-emptive. Anyone could create the same stunning animation in After Effects. It doesn&#8217;t mean the product will &#8220;feel&#8221; right.<p /> For example, when the user clips a section of the document by dragging, how does it know what to drag? This is an important usability concern.<span class="text_exposed_show" style="display: inline;"><p />Apple spends more time on usability than anyone. Every little detail must feel right. It&#8217;s what leads them to create such incredible solutions. Apple may have very well had some of these same concepts in place, and they may even be planning to implement them, but they know that it is much wiser to only show something upon completion rather than to over promise and under deliver.<p /> Apple definitely has to respond in some way, whether internally or externally, to these concepts. Is it better to have a smaller, foldable profile or one large display? MS has cleverly used the dividing bezel as a pocket &#8211; very cool &#8211; however, movies and media will not be as enjoyable on the Courier. Have you seen the new digital version of Wired for the iPad? It looks and &#8220;feels&#8221; incredible on such a large display. Wired will have to format around the dividing displays of the Courier, which I don&#8217;t think will turn out as presentable. Also, the dividing bezel is a bit of a barrier when it comes to using such tablets as input devices to computers. It&#8217;s also a barrier for games; not completely as games could take a Nintendo DS approach, but the unified, large display of the iPad is far more flexible. I also can&#8217;t help but feel a disconnect when I have to look from one display to the next. Such a dividing bezel helps with organization but hinders presentation.<p /> Ultimately, the cool thing about the Courier is the use of the pen. I think Apple is taking a wise approach in going with the &#8220;tactile&#8221; feel of the hands. However, someone, hopefully Apple, must release a pressure and tilt sensitive pen for the iPad. This is crucial for artists, entrepreneurs, students, virtually everyone. As Luke and I have discussed, such a pen could easily be made for the iPad&#8217;s existing technology by syncing the pen to the iPad over Bluetooth. Apple may choose to leave such Courier-like functionality and hardware to 3rd party app-makers and hardware vendors, which would be fine. Stylists for the iPhone/iPad already exist, but someone _has_ to make a pressure and tilt sensitive Bluetooth pen available for the iPad.<p /> Regardless, if the Courier can not sync with Macs, it&#8217;s a deal-breaker for me. The iPhone would not be where it is if it were not for its ability to sync with Windows. Also, as a developer, let me tell you that developing applications for Windows is really burdensome for many reasons that I will not go into here. Unless MS cleans up its development/API ecosphere for this solution, I don&#8217;t anticipate Courier development being as inviting as iPhone/iPad development.</span></p>

		The iPad.

So it doesn&#8217;t cure cancer, AIDS, and solve world hunger, but the Apple tablet was overhyped to begin with. Regardless, I am quite pleased with the result.

I feel like I did after I saw the iPhone 3G S &#8211; it&#8217;s cool, it&#8217;s in the right direction for tablets, netbooks, and readers; it is a tad underwhelming. I&#8217;d love to see an iSight on it. Perhaps Apple chose not to implement an iSight in order to keep the cost down. If so, good move on their part.&nbsp;Apple is known for pouring over every detail, and for whatever reason they chose to forgo an iSight on this iteration of the iPad,&nbsp;I have no doubt that the next version will have one.

I love that the iPad is unlocked, however, AT&amp;T is still the only carrier in which 3G is supported. T-Mobile uses a different frequency for their 3G and is thus incapable of providing 3G speeds to the iPad. Notice how both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile use GSM technologies, but 3G on the iPhone isn&#8217;t supported by T-Mobile. At the same time, the Nexus One has 3G supported by T-Mobile but not AT&amp;T.  T-Mobile is capable of delivering EDGE to both the iPhone and iPad, but EDGE is significantly inferior to 3G and undesirable. Verizon is implementing LTE this year, a  GSM based technology. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if this will support the iPad and iPhone&#8217;s 3G radio when it debuts.

What is truly great about the iPad?

Its potential.

While it does look like a large iPhone, I absolutely love how Apple is treating the iPad as a third medium. I was thoroughly impressed with how Apple did not merely port iWork to a super-iPhone-sized display, but took the time to creatively craft a UI and experience unique to the iPad. While it is easy to dismiss iWork as a &#8220;work app suite&#8221;, through iWork for the iPad, Apple has shown how the iPad&#8217;s screen and multitouch inputs can be taken advantage of from a usability perspective. This is important.

Address Book, iTunes, iPhoto, iBooks &#8211; these apps look solid. I love the tangible feel Apple is going for in flipping and manipulating pages and photos with your hand. Sure, the iPhone has had this, but flicking and flipping create two different experiences and emotional responses.

Over the years, the iPhone has exploded as a medium for creativity, engineering, and imagineering. The Wall Street Journal has demonstrated in their app that inline video can be displayed alongside text. Cool. I can&#8217;t wait to see this taken a step further with interactive media and textbooks*.  The potential to impact education, the textbook industry, liberal arts and technology is here; and it&#8217;s in the form of the iPad.

The future has arrived.


*UPDATE: After writing this, I learned of a company called INKLING that is <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2010/01/27/inkling-ipad/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=twitter-publisher-main&amp;utm_campaign=twitter">doing this very thing</a>.
