<p>Operating systems have evolved greatly in the past twenty years, and yet in many ways, they have still been tied to their old paradigms. Mac OS X Lion changes this. Raising the bar and setting a new standard for operating systems yet again, Apple takes the art of operating system design and innovation further into the 21st century with auto-save, versioning, resume, and more.</p>

<h4>Auto-Save</h4>

<p>You&rsquo;re working on your Microsoft Word document. You&rsquo;ve heard of auto-save. You may have even used it before when the power went out and Word brought your document back as it was prior to the crash. What you may not realize is that there are only two working versions of your document at any given time: the one you manually save and the auto-save copy. Whenever you recover via auto-save, the auto-save feature continues to overwrite its auto-save copy and you must manually save permanent changes.</p>

<p>As you&rsquo;re working on your document, you reach a point where you&rsquo;d like to try a couple different directions. We&rsquo;ll call this the fork snapshot. You make a copy of the document — copy A for one direction and copy B for the other. A few hours go by, but you realize that you don&rsquo;t really like copy A or copy B. You&rsquo;d like to go back to that fork snapshot. You&rsquo;ve changed a lot of text in both copies, and at the same time, you&rsquo;d like to keep a few of the changes from copy A and copy B. How do you get back to that fork snapshot? You now have a compound, time-consuming problem.</p>

<p><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-03-09/rrEontjrcqAomlpkpDEbajxkEFuagJfqlcGGhBqFHBaFurwogIoyqbfjJpdD/The-Problem.png?content_part=pid___0" alt="Lion's Versioning" /></p>

<p>Up to this point in the history of operating systems, you would have needed to have saved multiple copies of each document throughout your workflow. This would only serve to make the aforementioned issues even more compound. You would then have to navigate all of these files, copying and pasting between them, and you still would not be able to revert to the fork snapshot without rewriting lost or changed text unless you explicitly saved a copy at that time.</p>

<h4>Lion&rsquo;s Auto-Versioning</h4>

<p>Mac OS X Lion does not auto-save to a separate copy as described above. It <strong>auto-versions</strong> the actual file you are working on. It does this automatically whenever you open a file and for every hour that the file is open. What is versioning? Whereas traditional auto-saving saves a complete copy of the file, versioning efficiently saves snapshots of the file by saving only the changes that were made. These changes are saved within the file itself, so when you transfer, move, or copy the file, every snapshot of that file comes with it.</p>

<p>With Lion&rsquo;s auto-versioning, you no longer have to remember to make multiple copies and you no longer have multiple copies eating up space on your Mac. And while traditional revert file features can only revert the document to the last time it was saved, Lion lets you quickly revert the document to the last time it was opened. What about the previous issue with merging changes? With versioning, you can pull up the changes side by side and simply copy or drag over the changes you want to keep, from any version of that file throughout the history of its creation.</p>

<p><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-03-09/vCAasfnlDdAcwghlJzqbhoIyhsFaaCbABIoDCcFxeCnlnowBBeqqcGyskoFo/Lion-Versioning.png?content_part=pid___1" alt="Lion's Versioning" /></p>

<p>Software developers know first hand the crucial importance of versioning. Now you too can benefit from this system without any additional effort or thought.</p>

<h4>Resume</h4>

<p>Have you ever needed to close an application to save resources for a more intensive task? Ever had to close all of your apps to restart your computer or simply quit an application because you were done with it? Recall what a burden it was when you needed to return to that application only to have to navigate back to the photo you were working on, to reopen two documents you were working on side-by-side, or to reopen the browser tabs to the pages you were previously viewing. Mac OS X Lion&rsquo;s Resume abolishes this annoying monstrosity. With Resume, your applications open exactly as they were before the application was quit. Notice how the Dock no longer shows a running application indicator.</p>

<p><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-03-09/tAmAivieApCydooptiAggjgcfzaqejCqiigHoHzdGqcoCFjBptjrzEGBAgqi/Lion-Dock-Comparison.png?content_part=pid___0" alt="Lion Dock Comparison" /></p>

<p>GEEK NOTE: OS X already does intelligent resource allocation. What is to be determined is if Mac OS X Lion has done away with the concept of running applications as Apple did with their iOS devices. While this concept exists technically in terms of running or exited processes, to the user, an iOS app is either on the screen or it isn&rsquo;t. The user is not aware that iOS actually terminates applications when it needs more resources for others. This entire process is transparent because iOS applications resume nearly instantly as they were when reopened. OS X Lion could very well do the same. With SSDs becoming increasingly prevalent, the ability to resume an OS X application nearly instantly from a completely quit state is certainly possible.</p>

<h4>The Rest</h4>

<p>Mac OS X Lion offers much more than these three improvements. New features like Mission Control and Launchpad further refine the already excellent OS X user interface. AirDrop makes file sharing simple and elegant while Mail 5 brings a sleek new UI and an intelligent email threading system akin to Gmail&rsquo;s. New and refined gestures and animations make interacting with your Mac more fluid and natural than ever, with the <a href="http://triconium.com/the-art-of-unitasking/">Art of Unitasking</a> promoted by a new, system-wide Fullscreen API that enables developers to create richer, fullscreen applications. And Mac OS X Server is no longer a separate product. It is now updated and included in Mac OS X Lion, freely available for every Lion user to leverage.</p>

<h4>Unparalleled</h4>

<p>Apple continues to show that it is unparalleled in innovation, elegance, and attention to detail. They continue to push technology forward while refusing to give into complexity. Where others would allow user interface and user experience to suffer, Apple refuses to settle for good, choosing instead to strive for great. To see what lies ahead, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/">visit the official Mac OS X Lion page</a>. And do watch the gestures and animation demo to appreciate the precision, fluidity, and attention to detail that Apple affords to all of its products and services.</p>

<p>Mac OS X Lion arrives this Summer.</p>

		<p>Today, MacBook Pros are supposed to get Intel&#8217;s Light Peak, a.k.a. &#8220;Thunderbolt&#8221;. Here is a comparison of Light Peak to USB 3.0:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong>: Light Peak sports two 10 Gbps channels.</p>

<p>USB 3.0:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>5 Gbps (theoretical 14 Gbps)</p></li>
<li><p>Full duplex (same speed in both directions at the same time)</p></li>
<li><p>Backwards compatible with USB 2.0</p></li>
<li><p>Power and data</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Light Peak:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>10 Gbps (Theoretical 100 Gbps) per channel</p></li>
<li><p>Two channels</p></li>
<li><p>Full duplex (same speed in both directions at the same time)</p></li>
<li><p>Power and data</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-protocol (This is huge)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The big sell of USB 3.0 is backwards compatibility, but Light Peak&#8217;s multi-protocol ability is huge. This means Light Peak can actually run USB 3.0, HDMI, streaming protocols, video protocols, network protocols, and more, all at the same time across the same channel. This demonstration shows USB 3.0, Blu-ray, and a file transfer being done simultaneously across a single connection to the computer.</p>

<p>For those with copious USB external hard drives, USB 3.0 is a nice move forward and will be very successful due to its backwards compatibility alone. In terms of next generation buses, however, Light Peak is king. Its higher throughput and ability to run multiple-protocols, including USB 3.0, affords it the best of all worlds.</p>

		<p><a href="http://blog.movies.yahoo.com/blog/432-netflix-is-abandoning-dvds-customers-who-prefer-dvds">Netflix is removing the &#8220;Add to DVD Queue&#8221; option from streaming devices</a>. This option will still be available on the Netflix web site.</p>

<p>It is to be determined as to what capacity this change will take place:</p>

<p>1) If all streaming devices currently only show results for streamable titles, this change will be negligible. Users utilizing a streaming device are using it for the given purpose.</p>

<p>2) If this change prevents users from using apps that can search the entire Netflix catalog, allowing the user to add non-streamable titles to their queue, this is a poor, too-soon decision.</p>

<p>3) If searching for a title results in one that is not streamable, prompting the user to add it to their DVD queue from their web site instead, this is bad user experience.</p>

<p>Regardless, Netflix still has the following critical issues to overcome:</p>

<p>1) Netflix&#8217;s selection of streaming titles is poor. Netflix is fighting a difficult battle in acquiring streaming licenses, one that isn&#8217;t likely to be adequately resolved any time soon.</p>

<p>2) Where are the extras? Discs afford the luxury of extras: special features, behind the scenes, and more.</p>

<p>3) The average Internet connection speed and capacity is pathetic in the US compared to other parts of the world. What good are streaming titles if they need to re-buffer or must frequently drop in quality in order to maintain continuity?</p>

<p>4) Streaming media doesn&#8217;t even come close to the quality of a Blu-ray disc, and Netflix&#8217;s 720p &#8220;HD&#8221; titles suffer additional compression. We are a long way from being able to stream 1080p, Dolby Digital 5.1 movies and films at Blu-ray quality¹.</p>

<p>In order incentivize more customers to adopt streaming media, Netflix must resolve these issues.</p>

<p>¹ Note that even the Blu-ray rips one can pirate off of the Internet are of lower quality than a typical Blu-ray release.</p>

While it is unwise to challenge all of one&#8217;s critics, it is still important to consider their words. Be slow to speak, eager to listen. Integrity and wisdom derive from these things.

<p>Bind it to a key for easy access. To disengage, hit the key a second time or right click.</p>
<p>This makes it much easier to track targets and play on a trackpad. Also, if you&#8217;re using a trackpad or single button pointer device on a Mac, Holding CMD while clicking will act as a right click.</p>

		<p>Yesterday I felt stressed and cluttered because my Instapaper and starred items in Google Reader only seemed to ever increase. I decided I would tackle nearly two years of news articles in an effort to get to zero upon which I would develop habits for clearing them regularly. I spent literally all day on this, and in doing so, I felt additional stress as if I had to rush to get through it all. This only distracted me from being present with the information at hand.</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t do it. I couldn&#8217;t possibly get through them all. After hours I still had over 90 pages of articles in Instapaper and over 600 starred items in Google Reader. I had to make a choice.</p>
<p>I declared news bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I have chosen to become a seeker of information rather than a hoarder. I have decided to value my time and my thoughts first. I have decided to become a curator of my mind, saving only the information that is most useful and precious. The rest can be sought after when necessary.</p>

		<p>This morning my thoughts were abuzz. I obsessed. I thought of productivity, efficiency. Were my methods efficient? Maintainable? Could they scale?</p>

<p>It went further.</p>

<p>How much of the information that I have received in my life do I recall? Do I remember much of my schooling? How do I retain more information? What if I can&rsquo;t recall something in a time of need? What if I&rsquo;m wasting time reading things, taking them in, because I can&rsquo;t recall them? Is recalling them the point?</p>

<p>On and on.</p>

<p>Enough!</p>

<p>I decided to sit.</p>

<p>Yet even before I set my timer, I thought of sitting and of writing about sitting. What would I say? How would I form my words? I attempted to precompile my thoughts, writings, and speech as I ususally do.</p>

<p>Stop. Set the timer and sit.</p>

<p>I sat.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t done so in months. Yet while I didn&rsquo;t experience some transcedent experience as one rarely if ever does, I was able to calm myself. I listened to the whir of a hard drive. I listened to the horn of a passing train, and soonafter, the echo of the rails as the train sped towards its destination. And after?</p>

<p>Well, I still don&rsquo;t know if my methods are efficient. I still don&rsquo;t know if they will scale. I have no clue as to whether there are gaping holes in my structure for productivity; but I feel more at rest. It&rsquo;s not peace, it&rsquo;s not clarity, it&rsquo;s not even a feeling of refreshment. I simply feel more calm, more neutral and regular.</p>

<p>That is exactly where I need to be to focus and get things done.</p>

<p>Sit.</p>
