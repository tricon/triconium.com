		<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/forums/topic:12128">A post on the Vimeo forums a couple weeks ago has begun to cause quite a stir</a>.

Vimeo has changed their Terms of Service to state:

&#8220;VIMEO shall be entitled to unrestricted use of any Submission for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the submitter.&#8221;

In contrast, Blip.tv&#8217;s TOS states:

&#8220;Blip.tv respects the fact that your content is yours, and will not sell advertising on your content or sell your content without your permission.&#8221;

There&#8217;s a rather stark difference between these two TOSs. Vimeo backs up their TOS by stating, &#8220;For legal reasons and technical realities, we need to keep the language broad in our Terms &amp; Conditions; however, that being said, we do not generally commericialize any members&#8217; videos, and if you are making your posts private, it is very unlikely we ever would.&#8221;

I understand that when running a service such as Vimeo, things can get hairy on the legal side. Having a more liberal TOS in favor of Vimeo eases that pain for them. However, if Vimeo wishes to grow its user base and avoid a potential boycott, it needs to endure the pains of writing a more clearly defined TOS in favor of the user.

What <em>you</em> create should belong to you regardless of where you choose to host it. Vimeo has rights, but only as the distributor, not as the owner. Decide for yourself, but I for one will not be hosting any material on Vimeo until their TOS is reflective of Blip.tv&#8217;s attitude towards user content.

		My life will radically change for the better this year. This coming July, the lease on my apartment will end. I will be faced with a few options: I can renew the lease, relocate within Champaign, move in with Andrew and Stephanie in Springfield, move in with Nathan Philips in Springfield, move home, or relocate out of state.

For some time I have wanted to move to Austin, TX. Its center as a music, technology, and film hub has always excited me. I must say, though, that LA has attractive elements as well. Hollywood creates an atmosphere of opportunity with the rush of traffic and winding roads posing desirable foes for my motorcycle addiction. However, my time in LA reinforced a philosophical concept that I had forgotten: I am small and insignificant. While I am confident in my abilities, so are many others. It is a highly competitive world out there, and to &#8220;succeed&#8221; I must continue to work diligently and valiantly. I find this exciting and reassuring that my new-found direction is apt for me. I will be working as hard as I can to raise money so that come July, I can relocate out of state to pursue my passions.

With my partner, Luke, buying a house in Champaign, and my other partner, Brett, seeking to relocate to Champaign, this potentially poses a problem for our company. I am confident that we will be able to work something out. My current involvement in the company does not require my physical presence at this time. It is time that I take a big step towards my future. I have a vision. I have a goal. I have an ambitious future. I will see it fulfilled.

This means that my days in Champaign, IL are greatly numbered. I adore Champaign and have many fond memories of it, but my future lies elsewhere. Over the course of my vacation, I learned what kind of city-person I am. I adore LA for the weather and its film scene, but I am more of a New York City person. I love the industrial/business scene and can easily see myself living there some day. At the same time, film is my dream. I see Austin as a good compromise.

We shall see what the future holds.

		Meet the Motorola Aura &#8211; beautiful name, beautiful phone.

Featuring a high resolution display, the first radial LCD display on a consumer cell phone, and gorgeous laser etching that takes two weeks to complete, the Aura certainly has charm aside from its $2,000 price tag.  While not a competitor to the iPhone in terms of functionality or price, the Aura servers as an elegant alternative to standard phones in terms of design.  Unfortunately, Motorola has once again demonstrated their inability to polish their products.

Flip open the phone and the radial display switches to the phone&#8217;s menu after a brief pause.  This is the best that Motorola can do?  Motorola has a perfect opportunity to take advantage of their rather beautiful radial LCD screen, and a simple switch is all that they can come up with?  How about a vibrant animation of particles merging from the edge of the screen to the center, cataclysmically &#8220;birthing&#8221; the menu into existence.  Or a mechanical gear system that &#8220;unlocks&#8221; the menu.  Even a simple fade would be better than a simple switch.

Alas, Motorola continues to show that it is not the great company of the 80s that it once was.  Motorola, swallow your pride and take a look at what Apple does right:  Apple&#8217;s products aren&#8217;t merely attractive on the outside.  They&#8217;re through-and-through beautiful and polished.  Just as Blizzard and Epic polish their video games again and again, you, Motorola, need to realize that the artistry of hardware and software design is more alive and important than ever.  Be a leader, take us into the 21st century.  You can no longer sell yourself on your name alone.

		What is occlusion culling? Let&#8217;s break it down.

&gt;  Occlude: to stop, close up, or obstruct.
&gt;
&gt;  Cull: to select from a large quantity.


Occlusion culling is a concept that is crucial to 3D graphics. It is the use of algorithms to select from a large selection of polygons what geometry should be occluded, obscured.

Why?

Let&#8217;s take a look at a conventional 3D pipeline.

&gt; 1. Application / Scene
&gt;   1. Scene/Geometry database traversal
&gt;   2. Movement of objects, and aiming and movement of view camera
&gt;   3. Animated movement of object models
&gt;   4. Description of the contents of the 3D world
&gt;   5. <span style="color: white;">Object Visibility Check including possible Occlusion Culling</span>
&gt;   6. Select Level of Detail (LOD)
&gt; 2. Geometry
&gt;   1. Transforms (rotation, translation, scaling)
&gt;   2. Transform from Model Space to World Space (Direct3D)
&gt;   3. Transform from World Space to View Space
&gt;   4. View Projection
&gt;   5. Trivial Accept/Reject Culling
&gt;   6. Back-Face Culling (can also be done later in Screen Space)
&gt;   7. Lighting
&gt;   8. Perspective Divide - Transform to Clip Space
&gt;   9. Clipping
&gt;   10. Transform to Screen Space
&gt; 3. Triangle Setup
&gt;   1. Back-face Culling (or can be done in view space before lighting)
&gt;   2. Slope/Delta Calculations
&gt;   3. Scan-Line Conversion
&gt; 4. Rendering / Rasterization
&gt;   1. Shading
&gt;   2. Texturing
&gt;   3. Fog
&gt;   4. Alpha Translucency Tests
&gt;   5. Depth Buffering
&gt;   6. Antialiasing (optional)
&gt;   7. Display

_Note: this is but one example of a conventional 3D pipeline. Pipelines can vary._

As you can see, the conventional 3D pipeline contains a lot of science, math, logic, and engineering that we take for granted.  We&#8217;re going to be dealing with but one area of this today, and that is the one that has been highlighted: &#8220;Object Visibility Check including possible Occlusion Culling&#8221;.

Let&#8217;s say you have modeled a Dodge Viper in Maya, and it contains roughly one-hundred thousand polygons. You may be inclined to think that one-hundred thousand polygons isn&#8217;t too difficult for a modern computer to render in real time, and in thinking so you would be right. However, what if you want ten of your Dodge Viper models onscreen at once? You are now sending one million polygons to your rendering pipeline.

Without the aid of occlusion culling, your hardware would be rendering one million polygons. This can be a strain depending on the hardware you&#8217;re dealing with. Either way, this is considerably more computationally intensive and time consuming than say rending three-hundred thousand polygons.

Occlusion culling mitigates the overhead involved in rendering a scene such as this. While algorithms may vary, a simple solution can be imagined with the following pseudo-code:

&gt; 1. Determine the camera&#8217;s (user&#8217;s) field of view.
&gt; 2. From the camera, project a vector towards every point within the its field of view.
&gt; 3. If that vector comes into contact with a polygon, mark that polygon as visible.
&gt; 4. Render all visible polygons.

Instead of rendering all polygons, whether visible or not, only visible polygons are rendered. This process adds an overhead of its own, however the performance gained offsets this overhead considerably.

This technology is available to all sorts of mediums: film, video games, and research to name a few. Now the next time you are working with or enjoying something that involves 3D graphics, you can truly appreciate the science and hard work that have gone into such prolific technology.

I shall leave you with this: Umbra Software&#8217;s occlusion culling tech demo &#8211; quite impressive.
