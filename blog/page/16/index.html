<p>
Back in the late 1980s when <a href="http://www.janesaddiction.com/">Jane&#8217;s Addiction</a> was in its prime, I saw an interview where front man Perry Farrell was asked about sales figures for their albums. His response: &#8220;If I wanted to sell records, I&#8217;d work in a record store.&#8221; He knew that the key to success was touring, which the band did almost incessantly for about three years.

</div>
<p>
Flash forward 20 years, and it&#8217;s harder than ever for artists to make a living selling CDs. According to <a href="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2009/10/future-of-music-summit-115000-albums-and-only-110-hits.html">a report</a> in the Chicago Tribune, a speaker at the Future of Music Coalition gave a breakdown of album numbers that will be particularly shocking to young independent bands who hoped they&#8217;d be able to make a living selling discs. More than 115,000 new albums were released in the U.S. last year. Of those, 110  sold more than 250,000 copies in the U.S. last year&#8211;that&#8217;s not such a surprise, as big stars have always been rare. But only 1,500 titles cracked the 10,000 mark, and fewer than 6,000 sold a paltry 1,000 copies. 
</p>
<p>
To give you some idea what 1,000 copies means, that used to be the standard manufacturing run for self-produced CDs. Indie bands imagined that they would use a hundred or so discs for publicity&#8211;sending them to radio stations and reviewers, for instance&#8211;and then sell the rest to local fans and on tour. Selling 900 CDs at $12 a pop would gross almost $11,000, which would be enough to cover low-budget recording and manufacturing expenses and perhaps buy some new guitar pedals and drumheads. Nobody makes a living selling 1,000 CDs. (Nowadays, bands can order reasonably priced smaller runs from companies like <a href="http://www.discmakers.com/SelfServiceQuoter/">Disc Makers</a>, and even use manufacturing-on-demand from services like <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-10151957-27.html">Audiolife</a> and Amazon&#8217;s <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-10194355-27.html">CreateSpace</a>.) 
</p>
<p>
What about 10,000 discs? If you&#8217;re just starting out, making over $100,000 from CD sales sounds like a dream. Of course, you have to split that money among the band members, and anybody else who gets a cut, like the producer and manager. And if you&#8217;re signed to a label, you might already be that deep into the hole for your advance and recording expenses, so forget about royalties and just hope they&#8217;ll pay you an advance for the next one. At 10,000 copies, you&#8217;re probably getting a little radio play somewhere, so you might earn a few small paychecks from publishing royalties, and if you&#8217;ve got a good live act and are willing to tour endlessly, you might be able to sell more tickets than CDs over the course of a year. So perhaps 10,000 is the low-end baseline for making a living playing music. 
</p>
<p>
 Of the new titles released last year, almost 99 percent of them didn&#8217;t sell enough copies to let their creators earn a living from CD sales, and almost 95 percent of them didn&#8217;t sell enough copies to cover the most basic expenses involved in their recording.
</p>
<p>
You still think your unsigned band&#8217;s good enough to be in that slim line? Remember that these figures include CDs released by well-established artists like Bob Dylan and new artists who are the lucky recipients of massive publicity pushes by major labels. 
</p>
<p>
For an unknown band just starting out? Better polish those chops and gas up the van, then get ready to live on ramen noodles for a couple years. And don&#8217;t worry about devaluing your recordings by selling them cheap or giving them away&#8211;worry about getting enough fans to hear them so they&#8217;ll be interested in coming to your shows, and dragging a few friends with them.

		I am an emotional person, many times to a fault.

Films, art, technology, anything, I base my perspectives on a more thin-sliced, emotional attachment to the object, later utilizing my analytical mind to determine the constituents of my feelings. My emotions, my sentiments, define me as the artist that I am. They make me this ardent, driven man; but when it comes to achieving goals and completing tasks, emotions get in the way.

Perhaps it is time to actively disconnect.

I am reminded by the <a href="http://zenisstupid.com/">Zen is Stupid</a> episode, &#8221;<a href="http://zenisstupid.com/?p=162">Negotiation</a>&#8221;: &#8220;I think you have to disconnect,&#8221; says Gwen Bell.

Right. On. The. Head, Gwen.

I find that I am a better entrepreneur, a better leader, better at achieving goals and dreams when I personally disconnect from the task at hand. While it is easy to see how this can and should be applied towards objective situations such as the aforementioned, it applies to the artistic process as well.

When I am writing, I pour my heart out. I think. I dream. I write. What do I do once these words are down on paper? Nothing. Why? I am too involved in them. Perhaps I fear failure. Perhaps I am not satisfied with my work. Regardless, while this emotional attachment is fervent, thrilling, and moving, it is also binding. It motivates us, it drives us, it _is_ our passion. However, emotions are unstructured. Try to structure your emotions while submitting to them and you will find your feelings and creativity dampened. This is why we artists let our our emotions and imaginations run wild. It is liberating and ascending.

Emotions are fleeting, though. &#8220;Love is blind.&#8221; Why? That physical feeling is _so_ powerful that it prevents us from stepping back and rationally observing the situation. In &#8220;Blink&#8221;, Malcolm Gladwell describes how as the heart rises above 120bpm, blood flow is redirected from logical parts of the brain towards instinctual parts crucial for survival. In these moments we are rationally bound. I have felt this before. Now that I am aware of it, I can begin to control it. It is good to escape to the world of raw emotion from time to time, but when it comes to the process of setting and achieving goals, to acquiring our dreams, emotions only give us the vision &#8211; they do not get us to our goal.

These written words &#8211; what do I do with them?

So far, I have not done enough. They sit in my story-writing software waiting to be paired up with additional typographic mates. They are infused with emotion and intent, yet they lack structure. It is at this point that one must actively disconnect. While I am sure I am not the first to coin this term, active disconnect is what I refer to as the process in which one retains their umbilical cords of emotion, that which feeds and nurtures the work, to the piece itself, but takes a step back in order to assess the bigger picture &#8211; where am I going and how do I get there?

To define this in David Allen&#8217;s &#8220;Getting Things Done&#8221; terms (thanks, Patrick), this sequence is the bridge between the mind-mapping process (read: creative, emotional outpouring) and the organizational process (read: compiling, editing, structuring, defining).

It is this small but ever so important bridge that has been missing in my life. I am so in love with the creative process that I never separate myself from my work in order to actually give it form. Remember: &#8220;love is blind.&#8221; Thus these thoughts, dreams, and visions float on in a sea of abstraction. Amorphous, they refuse to take shape; but if you were to ask me for water, I could not simply pour it into your hands. It must be contained.

The more I reflect upon this approach of actively disconnecting, the more I see its truth. Art, business, technology, dreams, life, goals, the opposite sex &#8211; it is applicable in all situations. It is the symbiosis of emotion and form.

I recall one of my closest friends telling me: &#8220;I just had to do [this film].&#8221; Elaborating, he described how he could  could no longer dream of &#8220;someday.&#8221; He had to do it now. His passion to be a filmmaker stirred within him.

So what did he do?

He actively disconnected, and gave that passion form.


Emotion inspires. Ambition drives. Form defines.

		<p>I recently responded to an article that conjectured a &#8220;solution&#8221; to video game piracy that required fairly elaborate technology and partnerships. I thought I would share my thoughts on combating video game piracy with the rest of you.</p>

<p>The original article can be read here, though it is not a prerequisite to understanding my conclusion: <a href="http://www.gamehounds.net/2009/05/22/the-end-of-piracy/">http://www.gamehounds.net/2009/05/22/the-end-of-piracy/</a></p>

<p>My response follows.</p>

<hr />

<p>Cooper,</p>

<p>You definitely are tech savvy. Unfortunately, every idea within your proposition can be circumvented. It may take some time, but it can and will be. Rather than spending a copious amount of time describing how it can be broken, let alone difficult to implement, we should look at why games are pirated in the first place.</p>

<p>There was a poll a year or two ago by an independent video game developer that asked visitors why they pirated games. The top reasons were: to circumvent DRM, the cost of games, and poor quality games.</p>

<p>DRM.</p>

<p>DRM has always been beaten &#8211; it only takes a matter of time. Companies are wasting time and money by utilizing DRM. Of course Macrovision doesn&#8217;t want you to know its DRM is worthless, but it really is. Drop DRM. Yes, pirates will be enthused, but more importantly, legitimate customers, those whom are truly hurt by DRM, will be relieved.</p>

<p>Expensive games.</p>

<p>Years ago when MGS2 first came out for the Xbox, EB Games (now owned by Gamestop), sold the game for $20 a pop for the first week of its release. After that first week the price went up to $40. A manager at one of my local EB Games said they sold boxes of that game that first week. Why? The game was incredibly affordable. Even if you walked into the store with no knowledge of the game, taking a chance that a game may be bad at $20 is not a huge risk. $40-60? That is a big risk.</p>

<p>I also learned that charging $60 for this gen&#8217;s games is not actually due to increased development costs as some in the industry would like you to believe. It is actually because of this: Publishers/developers began releasing standard editions at $50 and special editions at $60, offering only minimal difference between the two. The special editions sold very well, telling publishers/developers that gamers were okay with paying $10 more for a game. One could argue that the special editions came with more, which technically they did, but it&#8217;s not like these special editions came loaded like Blizzard Collector&#8217;s Editions do. Charging $10 more was clearly not going to alienate the gaming majority.</p>

<p>Of course games are taking more and more to create; yet games cost about the same 5 years ago and 10 years ago, perhaps even 15 years ago. Games have become increasingly complex, yet they&#8217;ve remained relatively close in price point. I don&#8217;t find these price hikes fully justified.</p>

<p>Poor Quality Games.</p>

<p>Recently I bought Universe at War on Steam for $5 during a weekend sale. I had heard of the game, and it turns out that I had played it before, but I figured $5 was chump-change for a video game and whipped out my credit card. Fortunately the game turned out to be rather good, but $5 was not much of a risk at all to find out. Yet we have companies charging $50 for games like &#8220;Transformers&#8221;, which is horrid, and &#8220;Terminator Salvation&#8221;, which is only four hours long! I don&#8217;t mind paying $40 or so for a good game such as &#8220;Morrowind&#8221;, &#8220;Warcraft 3&#8221;, any game in the &#8220;Unreal Tournament&#8221; series, or many other quality games out there, but with so many mediocre games flooding the market, it&#8217;s not cost effective to take a chance at that price point. Bring the cost of games down, the quality of games up, and games will sell themselves.</p>

<p>Digital Distribution.</p>

<p>I absolutely abhorred digital distribution when Steam was launched. How dare I be told when and where I can play my games. Another reason I loved physical mediums was that they were much easier to run on an emulation layer in OS X and Linux. I have since changed my mind.</p>

<p>I have become so sick of physical discs, cases, and boxes lying around, let alone having to track down a manual for a CD key, that I am in the process of thinning my movie, music, and video game collection physically. I adore how Blizzard and Bioware let you store your CD keys online for easy retrieval. Blizzard even lets you download the game client. The same can be said of Steam. With Steam, I can easily download my purchases hassle-free. As a result,  I often look to digital distribution systems first when looking to purchase a video game. The downside is waiting for the game to download, but Steam has mitigated pre-orders through pre-loads, and this issue will continue to minimize as Internet connectivity speeds increase.?
Digital distribution is extremely enticing to publishers and developers for two primary reasons. One, it&#8217;s cost effective. Publishers don&#8217;t have to print and ship discs, cases, and manuals, let alone give a cut to retail stores. Two, it circumvents used game sales. Ideally I would like to see digital distribution services allow you to transfer your game license to another account at will, but I fear this will never happen &#8211; at least not for some time. While the downside of current implementations of digital distribution is the inability to resell your games, services are in development that will allow gamers to rent games digitally, making gaming even more cost effective, available, and on-demand. With a shift towards digital distribution for multimedia as a whole, I believe we will see mass adoption of digital distribution for video games very quickly &#8211; especially if publishers and developers lower the cost of their games as a result of the affordability and efficiency of digital distribution.</p>

<p>Conclusion.</p>

<p>Video games need to become more affordable, better in quality, stripped of all DRM, and available on digital distribution systems. Yes, pirates can crack even digital distribution systems, but video games will continue to be pirated regardless of medium. Potential video game customers need to be enticed into buying games over pirating games. These aforementioned methods lower the cost, increase the quality, and make a game easily accessible &#8211; three core principals to selling any product.</p>

<p>It is easy for any industry to blame pirates for their failures and flaws. Look at how bloated &#8220;sales lost to piracy&#8221; figures are. This is done for shock value. If you research how these figures are computed, you would probably laugh. Piracy is a real threat and a valid concern, but there are efficient, affordable means to combat this nuisance, reaching out to current and would-be pirates without harm to the legitimate customer.</p>

		I am a diehard Linux and Mac enthusiast. One of the key reasons for this is the shell environment that both operating systems share. A powerful shell is key to any quality operating system and allows you to perform actions that can be considerably more power than a GUI.

Recently, a friend of mine asked how he could get started in learning the shell. As the shell can initially appear a bit intimidating, I  decided to put together an introduction to the shell.

<br />
<strong>Getting Started</strong>

Entering the shell from a desktop environment is as easy as opening Terminal in OS X (/Applications/Utilities) or opening GnomeTerminal or Konsole in Linux (sorry Windows users. Windows has a completely worthless shell. You do have an option, though: install Cygwin. Details in the foot notes).

Upon opening your terminal application, you will be greeted with a command prompt.

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Wraith:~ tricon$</blockquote>

Typically this prompt will consist of your computer name, current directory, user name, and end with a &#8220;$&#8221;. This &#8220;$&#8221; shows that you are logged in as a user (more on this later). Note that in this case my current directory is displayed as <b>~</b>. <b>~</b> means &#8220;home directory&#8221; or &#8220;user directory&#8221;, and is where files pertaining to your user account are located.

<br />
<b>ls</b>

The first command to learn is one you will use frequently: <strong>ls</strong>. Type this now and hit return.

<strong>ls</strong> is short for &#8220;list&#8221;. This command lists all files in the current directory.

Most commands have options. These options adjust the way a command operates or what it operates on.

A useful option for the <strong>ls</strong> command is <strong>-a</strong>. Note that <strong>-</strong> typically denotes that you are issuing options to the command in order to differentiate from a parameter. These parameters can be additional input, a file, or another form of input that the command requires (more on parameters later).

Before you re-run <strong>ls</strong> with the <strong>-a</strong> option, I&#8217;m going to teach you a very useful trick. Hit the <strong>up arrow</strong> on your keyboard. This will bring back the last command you typed. In fact, you can keep hitting the <strong>up arrow</strong> to cycle through your past commands. 

Hit the up arrow and append <strong>-a</strong> to the <strong>ls</strong> command.

<strong>ls -a</strong> lists all files in the current directory, including hidden ones. Files beginning with a period are considered hidden.

Now type: <strong>ls -l</strong>

Here we provided two options to <b>ls</b>: <b>-a</b> and <b>-l</b>. With most commands you can append them behind a single <b>-</b>.

Notice that when using <b>-a</b> with the <b>ls</b> command there are two odd looking entries: <b>.</b> and <b>..</b><br />
<b>.</b> refers to the current directory that you are in while <b>..</b> refers to the parent directory &#8211; the one above the current directory. These are very useful and lead us into the next command.

<br />
<b>cd</b>

<b>cd</b> stands for &#8220;change directory&#8221;. This allows you to move between directories in the shell.

Type: <b>cd ..</b>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>Wraith:~ tricon$ cd ..
Wraith:Users tricon$</pre></div>
</div>


<b>cd ..</b> means &#8220;change to directory ..&#8221; Since <b>..</b> refers to the parent directory, you just went up a directory in the shell.
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>Wraith:Users tricon$ ls
Shared        tricon</pre></div>
</div>


We are now in the directory for user accounts (/Users/ in OS X; /home/ in Linux). You should see your username in this listing. Here&#8217;s a neat trick. Type: <b>cd</b> followed by a letter or two of your username and hit the <b>tab</b> key. Your username was just auto-completed.

Auto-completion is a huge time saver. At any point while you are typing part of a path, you can hit <b>tab</b> to auto-complete the part of the path you are typing. But what happens when there are multiple possibilities? Hitting <strong>tab</strong> the first time will do nothing on the command line (thought it will typically make a beeping noise). Hitting <b>tab</b> again will list the possibilities. In order for <b>tab</b> to auto-complete, you need to type enough characters so that the possibilities are narrowed down to one, at which point hitting <b>tab</b> will auto-complete.

You&#8217;ve just learned two very common and important commands. This next command is one of the most important as it will allow you to learn how to use virtually any command.

<br />
<b>man</b>

<b>man</b> is short for &#8220;manual&#8221;. This command will display the manual, or &#8220;man page&#8221;, for virtually any command. Type: <b>man ls</b>.

You will be shown a window with all of the details you could ever want to know about the <b>ls</b> command. Within this screen you can use the arrow keys to navigate. Hit <b>q</b> to &#8220;quit&#8221; and return back to the command prompt.

<br />
<b>Homework</b>

For your homework, practice changing directories and listing their contents. For bonus points, practice using some of the available options listed in the man page for each command.

<br />
<b>Final Notes</b>

You have begun your journey to learn one of the most powerful ways to interact with a computer: the command line. While these two commands may not seem like much, they are building blocks for a shell that features hundreds of commands. These copious commands allow you to do virtually anything, from mass renaming files to looking under the hood of your operating system, automating tasks, and beyond.

In part two we&#8217;ll cover more commands, show you how to manage files from the shell, and explain what attributes are and why they are important.

<br />
<strong>Cygwin</strong>

For you Windows users out there, there is hope! Cygwin is a Linux shell environment for Windows. Upon installing this, you will be able to launch a program from your Start Menu that will provide you with a shell nearly identical to the ones available in OS X and Linux.

Cygwin can be found here: <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>

		In mid 2007, through a Ruby on Rails podcast, I discovered an up-and-coming service called, &#8220;Twitter&#8221;. Twitter was a service that made sense to me. Fascinated, I saw its potential, and nearly a month later I had the beginnings of a personal network of acquaintances and future friends. 

Nearly two years later, Twitter is still a part of my daily routine.

For my reflection, I would like to mention some of the Tweeple that I have grown closer to because of Twitter. These select individuals have transcended from Internet acquaintances to real life friends.

<a href="http://www.grahamenglish.net/">Graham English</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/grahamenglish/">@grahamenglish</a>)<br />
Graham was one of my early mutual follows. A successful musician, blogger, and a fellow coffee aficionado, Graham has become very dear to me. In the early days of Twitter, we connected through our love of keyboards, music, and Macs. Nearly two years later, we have grown to share views on politics, science, religion, film, and life in general. I greatly admire Graham for his fervor for music, making a living out of what he loves, and as a freelancer. Graham is the kind of friend that always has your back. I most certainly will always have his. While I have not had the pleasure of meeting Graham in person, I aim to do so within the next year, buying each other that beer we have been promising.

<a href="http://gwenbell.com">Gwen Bell</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/gwenbell">@gwenbell</a>)<br />
I discovered Gwen Bell&#8217;s blog through Graham English. As one of the most passionate individuals I have known, Gwen&#8217;s expertise is broad, ranging from social media to technology, spirituality, humanism, and beyond. Her enthusiasm not only brightens my Twitter stream, it inspires me personally. A creative woman, I will never forget a hilarious prank her and I pulled on our mutual friend, Patrick Reynolds. Hearing her unforgettable laugh brings a smile, reminding me of what a caring, light-hearted woman she is.

<a href="http://hereliespatrick.com">Patrick Reynolds</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/patrickcantype">@patrickcantype</a>)<br />
Through Gwen&#8217;s blog and the podcast she co-produces, &#8220;Zen Is Stupid&#8221;, I discovered a man on a mission. That man was Patrick Reynolds. His mission: The Peak Condition Project. His goal: to achieve the body of Bruce Lee through daily exercise and conscious, life-long change in body and mind. He succeeded and has now developed a business inspiring others to make such changes in their lives as well. Also a music connoisseur and graphic designer, Patrick is wise and understanding, having helped me through many parts of my life.  A visionary, Patrick has become dear friend, and a model of hard work and dedication.

<a href="http://www.rambls.com/">Jeff Ledoux</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/rambls">@rambls</a>)<br />
My friendship with Jeff is a perfect example of how truly small the world is. Over a year ago I emailed the web service Me.dium suggesting they release a plugin for Safari. A response came from a man named Jeff Ledoux. As further emails were exchanged, Jeff and I began to connect and develop a friendship; one that branched through IM, Twitter, and other web sites and services. Jeff and I have a deep friendship that has allowed us to open up about very personal parts of our lives &#8211; a friendship that is only growing stronger.

<a href="http://www.ocell.net/">Chris Owens</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/ocell">@ocell</a>)<br />
Chris Owens is an upcoming industrial designer. His attention to detail and taste for quality art and product design is inspiring, and his penchant for 3D imagery gives us a common ground. My friendship with Chris solidified when we discovered that we were both on a journey. Taking the conversation to a more personal level, Chris and I were able to relate further and encourage each other. Chris has become a very good friend, and I am looking forward to watching our friendship evolve even further.

<a href="http://www.jefftippett.com">Jeff Tippett</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/jefftippett">@jefftippett</a>)<br />
Jeff Tippett is many things rolled into one. He is a people-person, a natural leader, outgoing, and an incredible friend. Jeff is one of my early mutual follows as well, and is one of the few people I have met over the Internet that I have actually talked to on the phone. Jeff has always been there for me, whether he is offering words of wisdom, cracking a joke, or making a friendly jab. He inspires me through his words, character, and love for his children. I adore Jeff and know that our friendship is just beginning.

<a href="http://leahwallace.wordpress.com/">Leah Wallace</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/matthewsChick">@MatthewsChick</a>)<br />
Leah is one of the most energizing women I have ever met. Full of life, love, and laughs, Leah is the kind of friend you always greet with a hug. Her warm demeanor and love for her friends and family is intoxicating, setting an example of how truly beautiful the selfless love of others is. Though my friendship with Leah has just begun, her reception of our new-found friendship has made me feel as if we have been friends for years. Leah is truly a blessing, and I am thankful for her friendship.

Jerry Chen (<a href="http://twitter.com/jcsalterego">@jcsalterego</a>)<br />
Some time ago, I received a new follower notification. It was a man named Jerry Chen. Following him back, I learned that he used to live here in Champaign, IL, and now lives where I intend to move: Austin, TX. Jerry cracks me up as he is highly intelligent and witty. We always have something to chat about as he is also a programmer, though he worships the snake (Python) as I envy the gem (Ruby). Jerry introduced me to an IRC channel for Champaign-Urbana computer scientists, and it was through this chat channel that I was able to get to know Jerry better, meet like minds, and make new friends.

<a href="http://sweetcinnamonwontons.com/">Don Yuhas</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/DonAtPoundCS">@DonAtPoundCS</a>)<br />
Don Yuhas is a badass. I was introduced to Don through Jerry as Don hangs out in the aforementioned chat channel. We shortly began following each other on Twitter, finally meeting at the first C-U Tweetup on April first. Don is a computer scientist and future fellow motorcyclist. He is an incredibly supportive, welcoming individual and is the kind of person that you are always eager to chat or hang out with. I look forward to getting to know Don better over the coming years.

<a href="http://www.twoslashes.com/">Nick Tabick</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/nicktabick">@nicktabick</a>)<br />
I first met Nick Tabick in the aforementioned chat channel and later in person at the local Tweetup. Thoughtful, intelligent, and open-minded, Nick is a person whose advice I greatly trust. Though programming, Linux, and classic PC gaming give us plenty of ground to relate on, it is his cool, collected, welcoming presence that makes Nick one of the most unforgettable people I have met. He is an incredibly observant individual, and while I have not known Nick very long, is quickly becoming a good friend.

<br />
Twitter has opened social doors over the Internet in a whole new way. Unlike services like Facebook that connect already connected individuals, Twitter is about building a network &#8211; your network. Through friends, mentions, and search, one can begin to build a personalized community organized around like minds and common ground, or differences. You decide. Your Twittersphere allows you to receive influence from those you follow while allowing you to exert influence upon those that follow you. It is a powerful system.

I, for one, am thankful. I am thankful for the opportunity Twitter has given me to get connected to others, to become acquainted, to become friends. Graham, Gwen, Patrick, Jeff, Chris, Jeff, Leah, Jerry, Don, and Nick &#8211; thank you. Thank you for your follows, and most importantly, thank you for your friendship.

Thanks to all of you for connecting with me, whether on this blog, Twitter, IRC, or otherwise.

This is just the beginning.
