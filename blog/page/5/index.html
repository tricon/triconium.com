	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-introduces-new-plans-and.html">Netflix&rsquo;s blog and Twitter account are being hammered by customers upset over the 60% price increase Netflix will be levying on many customers starting September 1st</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>Plan 1: Unlimited Streaming (no DVDs) for $7.99 a month
Plan 2: Unlimited DVDs, 1 out at-a-time (no streaming), for $7.99 a month.</p>

<p>The price for getting both of these plans will be $15.98 a month ($7.99 + $7.99).</p></blockquote>

<p>While many are understandably upset over this significant increase, the story does not end with greed.</p>

<p>Streaming is a considerably more cost effective content delivery system than mailing DVDs. <a href="http://www.techspot.com/news/42036-mail-service-costs-netflix-20-times-more-than-streaming.html">According to Emil Protalinski at TechSpot</a>, Netflix pays up to $1 when a customer chooses to utilize their DVD service. In contrast,
<a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/the_business_of_online_vi/2011/03/netflixs-streaming-costs-drop-50-from-2009-expected-to-spend-50m-in-2011.html">Dan Rayburn estimates that it costs Netflix just $0.025 to stream content to a customer</a>. For Netflix, the cost savings are colossal. Compounding the issue, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/07/08/technology/netflix_starz_contract/index.htm?hpt=hp_t2">Julianne Pepitone reports that content providers are looking to charge Netflix more in upcoming negotiations</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>When streaming video was new, Netflix was able to secure contracts with the likes of Warner Bros. Studios and MTV to license big TV and film catalogues for about $5 million to $10 million per year. This time around, Pachter says, those costs could increase more than tenfold.</p></blockquote>

<p>A bigger picture begins to emerge: If content providers charge Netflix more, that cost is passed on to the customer. Yet if customers no longer deem Netflix a worthy service, Netflix and the content providers&#8217; revenue is impeded â€” we all lose.</p>

<p>Though they may be justified, no customer appreciates price hikes. Such situations must be mitigated through top-notch customer service, often by grandfathering current or loyal customers into special pricing plans. Considering the noise being generated by the Twittersphere, Netflix must respond. This is their chance to address customers&#8217; concerns, ensuring them that these cost savings to Netflix will be used to acquire additional, quality content for and future technological expansion of their streaming service.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been saying this for a while now. If I were to direct a &#8220;Half-Life&#8221; film (a dream of mine), I would cast Bryan Cranston as an older Morgan Freeman. Incredible actor.</p></div>

		<h2>Simplicity</h2>

<p>About every three months or so, I fall into &ldquo;ADD&rdquo; regarding some aspect of my life or workflow. Often it is in regard to text editors. Vim? Emacs? TextMate? Aptana? Choices! They stress me out.</p>

<p>I always come back to simplicity. While I still use Vim quite often, I find myself returning to TextMate again and again. It&rsquo;s so simple, so easy to configure. I could say the same of Xcode. Is it heavier than TextMate? By far, but clicking a button to have a project built, deployed, and run is simple.</p>

<p>Simplicity.</p>

<p>I recently went through this with organizational methods. I&rsquo;ve tried the GTD approach before, and while I admire David Allen and his method, the only aspect that ever stuck with me was that of contexts. I find GTD to be a bit <em>too</em> structured for me due to its overhead.</p>

<p>A while back I started using a free app called Pomodoro for working in twenty-five minute sprints. I would sometimes combine this with SelfControl to limit my access to certain websites during the sprint. I enjoyed the work-break model that this afforded me and recently have begun embracing the Pomodoro Technique fully.</p>

<p>Just before I purchased a book called, &ldquo;The Pomodoro Technique Illustrated&rdquo;, I hesitated as I thought, &ldquo;Does this really merit a book? It&rsquo;s just twenty-five minute sprints, right?&rdquo; Instead, I found the additional instruction useful. The Pomodoro Technique does require additional work but not much. I find the Activity Inventory inviting as it allows me to brain dump my to-dos. Using the To Do Today list, I decide at the beginning of each day what I will tackle. I consciously accept that I will not work on the rest. Logging internal and external interruptions seems tedious, but you begin to realize that it&rsquo;s a form of psychological punishment for allowing yourself to be distracted. It can also reveal patterns in your schedule that can aid in further structuring your day to avoid common interruptions. Finally, voiding a Pomodoro is the ultimate punishment. It&rsquo;s not so much time wasted as it is a reminder to stay completely focused for those twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>I began using pen and paper as the author suggested. More than once he said to do so as it allows you to easily modify your tracking and reporting. This is true, but I just can&rsquo;t do it. I love handwriting, but I obsess so much over my poor handwriting that I am prevented from writing. Instead of enjoying the writing process, instead of listening to the muse and embracing the words, I dread writing due to my obsessive compulsive nature.</p>

<p>I found an app called Pomodoro App for iPad on the App Store and have found it to be a near-complete Pomodoro solution. Something just feels right about pressing the start and break buttons. Seeing the timer tick, hearing it tick, being able to quickly and easily load up my Activity Inventory, To Do Today list, and log interruptions, these features allow me to focus even more on just getting things done. I no longer have to stress over scraps of paper and poor handwriting. I just do.</p>

<p>Here I am in iA Writer typing away. This application has zero options. You can&rsquo;t even change the font. There is nothing to get in my way even though it has additional, powerful features such as Markdown support and HTML export. But guess what: the application does not make the artist. Great tools do not define their artists, they enable them. Using iA Writer does not make me a better writer. It doesn&rsquo;t make me write more. It&rsquo;s not a magic bullet for kicking the anti-writing bug. It enables me. It allows me to flow with no interruptions or potential distractions. I must decide to do. iA Writer defines the how.</p>

<p>Do you know what TextMate, Pomodoro, and iA Writer all have in common? They are simple. They are powerfully simple.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>Tick, tick, tick. The Pomodoro timer ticks away. It gives me rhythm. That&rsquo;s what the Pomodoro Technique is all about â€” rhythm. Work, break, work, break. Type, stretch, code, coffee. Rhythm. For some time I have felt that I have needed structure, yet the thought of fully embracing the left or the right, this or that, stresses me out to no end. It goes against the grain of who I am. It undermines my call to spontaneity. Yet, pure spontaneity often leaves me wanting more structure as I struggle to accomplish. There is a balance, and I have found it. It lies in powerfully simple structure.</p>

<p>I can see these patterns now. I can see why I like what I do. This has been within me all along, buried within, and it hasn&rsquo;t been until now, until I took the time to write about it, that I was able to see the &ldquo;why&rdquo;. It feels good. It feels good to write. It feels good to know a little more about myself, to be a little more defined.</p>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t we all seeking identity in some form? I am. Like a swaying pendulum, I have met both extremes. I am finally coming to rest somewhere towards the middle. Writing is my outlet. I shall defeat Resistance and embrace it. I shall write more. I shall speak my mind more. I shall be right more. I shall be wrong far more often. I shall be egotistical and humble, crude and supportive, spiteful and loving, weak and strong. I shall be.</p>

		<p><em>6:57 AM</em></p>

<p>Why is it than when I think of or attempt to do something that is important to me, I always find a way to not do it, to avoid it? This is a rhetorical question as I know the answer: doing these things would make me happy. If you fail to understand why our bodies do not want us to be happy, you must read Steven Pressfield&rsquo;s, &ldquo;The War of Art&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As I write this, my fingers drudge on. I wish they would dance, but alas, the energy, the music is not there for them to do so. They behave like an orchestra without a conductor, voicing their potentially melodic opinions without beat, without order, without soul.</p>

<p>Regardless, I command them to drudge on. March! Stop! Push! Pull! March!</p>

<p>I must tame these tiny dancers that they might tame me. They are the workers and I am their master. I care for them. I want what&rsquo;s best for them, but I recognize that what is best for them is what is best for me. We can work together.</p>

<p>Aha! I&rsquo;m on to you, stomach. I feel you craving breakfast. Stop. Stop! You <em>will</em> stop. I know it&rsquo;s not your fault, it&rsquo;s that damn subconscious â€” no â€” it&rsquo;s that damn Resistance feeding you lies. &ldquo;But I must eat! Please! Feed me lest I starve!&rdquo; Ha! I will not starve and thus you shan&rsquo;t either. Now be quiet! I am sharpening my blade to defeat the beast that is Resistance today. I&rsquo;ll have to face him yet again tomorrow, but with practice comes experience; so please, hush now as I need to think.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling better already. I&rsquo;m feeling more revitalized now. Yes, I&rsquo;m on to you too, brain. I know you want a nap, but all you will get is coffee, work, and thoughts until tonight, so get ready to process some information. What&rsquo;s that? I <em>know</em> you&rsquo;ve been up for seven hours already. Does it look like I care? Stop your whining and perk up.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s better. Anyone else? Anyone else feel like griping? That&rsquo;s what I thought.</p>

<p>Okay, now. What do I need to do today? Well, I really want to blog every day, so I need to do that. I should probably do some creative writing as well. I keep putting my stories off with the excuse that I just need to take care of some things first, but I know that is a lie. I can do today what I wish to put off &lsquo;til tomorrow.</p>

<p>Code, yes, more code must be spewed into the world. Noted. Friends? Yes, I should see friends today. Tell you what. How about I get four hours of work in, blog, creatively write for an hour, and then I can see friends. Does that work for you? What&rsquo;s that? You want to just veg for now? Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. You thought I actually cared what you thought. I was just being polite. This is what we&rsquo;ll be doing today; and I just discovered what I am going to write about.</p>

		<p>For some time I have been intending to write every day. It is a goal I have failed at over and over again. Lately I&rsquo;ve been desiring more structure, as I often to periodically,  occurring every few months like a sine wave without fail.</p>

<p>I have been here before. I have tried before. I have failed before. As with a previous occurrence, I have no fuzzy emotions about this. No &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this!&rdquo; bursting through my veins. Just cold, semi-objective, &ldquo;This needs to be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will slip again. I will fail to write for a day or two. This time I have a dear friend that is going to keep me accountable to writing every day. This time I have a new friend that is going to coax me when it comes to writing technology related posts. This time things will be different.</p>
