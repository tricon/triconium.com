I recently purchased Apple&rsquo;s Magic Trackpad off of a friend (thanks, Jeff), and I have come to love it. Not only do I find trackpads more accurate and direct than mice, a third party tool has allowed me to replicate all of the functionality of my MX Revolution and more.  The app: <a href="http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=1722">BetterTouchTool</a>
[[posterous-content:mb2FVhvJjKmeNznQ5NIJ]]
BetterTouchTool allows you to remap the gestures of the touchpad to virtually anything you wish. Want to remap four finger swipe down? No problem. Pinch to zoom? Yep. Not only can you remap these gestures globally, you can remap them on a per-application basis. This allows you to create uniformity across your apps. Just as a three finger swipe left and right allows you to go back and forth between folders in Finder, the same gesture can be applied to iTunes to navigate tracks.
[[posterous-content:9I3bc7VmrJHKSmnEsJSU]]
BetterTouchTool also provides a number of gestures that aren&rsquo;t directly supported by Apple: five finger gestures, tiptap gestures, complete thumb cancellation, and more.  BetterTouchTool isn&rsquo;t only limited to the Magic Trackpad, however. It can also be used with the Magic Mouse as well as the trackpad built in on your MacBook, providing it has multitouch support. In addition, it offers advanced controls and experimental features for perfecting your input methods.
[[posterous-content:UTGEXGJdpus9E9exD8ho]]
<strong>Do note</strong>: BetterTouchTool is still in development and far from complete. Some gestures don&rsquo;t pick up every time which is frustrating. Regardless, it still proves useful for extending the capabilities of your multitouch peripheral and will only get better in time.</p>

<p>If you utilize multitouch peripherals, this is a no brainer. <a href="http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=1722">Download BetterTouchTool now</a>.</p>

		<p>In response to <a href="http://seldo.com/weblog/2010/09/27/php_needs_to_die_what_will_replace_it">this article</a>, Mike C in the comments writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mike C</p>

<p>In the phrase &ldquo;I want a language that assumes everything I will be building is an MVC web app, and builds that right into the core language, not just a library&rdquo; you&rsquo;re missing a key ingredient: the IDE. For those of you who have never used MIcrosoft&rsquo;s Visual Studio for writing an ASP.NET MVC application, the amount of work that the IDE does for you is incredible. While you <em>could</em> all of the files needed for a web app in Notepad (or gEdit, if you&rsquo;re into that) the amount of code you would need to write is considerable &mdash; it&rsquo;s precisely the kind of &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; crap that should be handled for you by the developing environment.</p>

<p>In addition to handling a lot of the coding work for you (but certainly not &ldquo;magic coding&rdquo;) it&rsquo;s important to not overlook the ability to debug an application in the IDE. When writing .NET code I can walk line-by-line through a running application, looking at variable values. In PHP I have to do something like &ldquo;echo $var; end;&rdquo; and keep moving that &ldquo;debug in the browser&rdquo; echo statement until I find the problem.</p>

<p>I like the idea of having a language specifically created for the purpose of making a web application, but without a holistic view &mdash; web server/mod, web framework, language, IDE, storage/model extensibility, client-side technology/jQuery &mdash; this whole conversation is pretty much meaningless.</p>

<p>And the biggest point the author is missing: HTML5 is the next revolution that will radically change the way we write the server-side code of our web apps.</p></blockquote>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve grown up with general purpose editors such as VIM, Emacs, and TextMate, I have come to appreciate the heavy lifting and <strong>perspective</strong> an IDE can provide.  Take Xcode for example. It is certainly not without its flaws, but the boilerplate code it generates, the easy debugging, the code sense, and its other workflow-improving features, make developing Objective-C apps considerably easier than in an editor such as TextMate. (I certainly do love TextMate, though, and wish I could somehow embed it within Xcode &mdash; best of both worlds.)</p>

<p>It is these productivity enhancements that have made me yearn for a quality, native IDE for Rails development. NetBeans is the best I&rsquo;ve found in terms of UI, but it still suffers from non-native UI elements that are a pain to use as well as slow, clunkiness in general.</p>

<p>Choosing an IDE or editor is certainly a matter of taste, but once applications grow beyond a certain size, it seems IDEs really begin to show their value and almost become a necessity.</p>

<p>Where do you stand? IDE or editor?</p>

<p>It used to be that your operating system effectively only let you run a single application at a time. Since computers weren&#8217;t very fast, users would have to shut down an application and wait for the next application to launch before they could resume their work. This was not effective.</p>
<p>Eventually the evolution of hardware and software brought about the oh-so-coveted multitasking. Great! Now people could run dozens of applications and switch between them on a whim. Even better, users could view two applications side by side or watch a movie while they worked; because, you know, humans are incredibly efficient machines and can look in two directions at once.</p>
<p>Sarcasm aside, multitasking has enabled us to accomplish more while allowing us to accomplish less. The problem is that our brains only multitask on certain levels. Cognitively, our brains more-so Fast Context Switch, which is akin to the Fast Application Switching that occurs on mobile devices today. Just as there is overhead when computers switch contexts, there is overhead when your brain does so as well. Have you ever experienced a sudden lack of awareness, like you needed to get your bearings, when switching from one application to the next? Your brain has changed state and it must now process all the new information that it has aggregated.</p>
<p>Multitasking is effective when actions are orderly chained: you just finished a web design mockup in Photoshop so you are now switching to Fireworks to slice it, or you are switching to TextMate to implement it. Multitasking is devastating when switching between unrelated contexts: you&#8217;re working in TextMate and flip over to Safari to check Twitter. Ouch! You must now order and process information all over again once you switch back to TextMate.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can get your bearings quickly, but these context switches add up over time. It&#8217;s even worse when you were in deep thought, when you had concentration or were &#8220;wired in&#8221; as they say in &#8220;The Social Network&#8221;, and you now have to earn that all over again &#8211; and concentration is truly something you earn with great effort and practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Looking at iOS</strong></span></p>
<p>iOS is a prime example of cognitive unitasking and proper multitasking. iOS allows only certain processes to be run in the background. On a technical level this saves on resources. iOS also only allows one application to take up the screen at any given time. On a cognitive level, this encourages unitasking; and iOS has the perfect animation for switching contexts.</p>
<p><object height="417" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nxLVCe-ETRg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" />
<param name="wmode" value="window" />
<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" />
<embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nxLVCe-ETRg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" wmode="window" height="417" width="500"></embed></object></p>
<p>Applications literally switch places. This gives an immediate visual cue and emotional feeling that contexts are being switched. It also gives the user a moment to prepare for the new context.</p>
<p>Compare this to the previous animation in iOS when opening a link in Safari from within another application (skip to 4:17).</p>
<p><object height="300" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/L27yVbGrcm4#t=4m17s&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;hd=1" />
<param name="wmode" value="window" />
<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" />
<embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/L27yVbGrcm4#t=4m17s&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;hd=1" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" wmode="window" height="300" width="500"></embed></object></p>
<p>The current application zooms away while Safari zooms in. This creates a completely different emotional feeling, one that is far more jarring and makes the user feel less in control.</p>
<p>Regardless, iOS effectively enforces unitasking. The result is devoted attention. Consequently, switching applications is easy yet painful in that it requires additional effort to do so &#8211; a good reason to have a workflow defined.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at Lion</span></strong></p>
<p>Apple is bringing the art of unitasking to the desktop and laptop OS in their upcoming release of OS X: Lion. While switching applications is as easy as ever, and more orderly thanks to the new Mission Control UI, Apple is encouraging applications to have a fullscreen mode, providing a native API for doing so. The result is this:</p>
<p><object height="417" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bEeGJkp1wt4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" />
<param name="wmode" value="window" />
<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" />
<embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bEeGJkp1wt4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" wmode="window" height="417" width="500"></embed></object></p>
<p>Easy. Organic.</p>
<p>Fullscreen modes allow the user interface to be reorganized in a completely different way, focusing the user on the given application and the tasks at hand. Fullscreen is undeniably powerful in its ability to encourage and enforce unitasking, and as desktops and laptops generally have larger screens than mobile devices, applications can still be laid out side by side for those moments when you need to reference one application while working within another.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Multitasking is Overrated</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">On a functional level, multitasking serves a very important purpose. On a higher level, it is adverse to productivity. Multitasking has become a buzzword in which many think it synonymous with productivity; but as Merlin Mann said in &#8221;<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/10/06/broken-meetings">Broken Meetings</a>&#8221;, multitasking is something everyone says they&#8217;re good at, but in practice, isn&#8217;t. </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">We&#8217;re seeing a trend towards a new hybrid of multitasking empowered unitasking &#8211; multitasking done right.

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">P.S. Empower yourself. The ability to produce and deliver isn&#8217;t resolved by unitasking at a technical level. <a href="http://zenhabits.net/">Learn to focus</a>, <a href="http://www.themindfulist.com/">become mindful</a>, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">discover new techniques</a>.</span></strong></span></p>

		<p>Over the years I have tried many different forms of digital organization. The search-don&#8217;t-sort method, where you throw things in generic folders such as Documents then search for them, proved too chaotic. It also discouraged browsing, which can remind one of forgotten documents as well as trigger new thoughts and concept</p>
<p>Meticulously sorting documents into folders is often too time consuming. While it is &#8220;browsing friendly&#8221;, it lacks flexibility. Does an article on historical fiction go under fiction, history, or writing?</p>
<p>Tagging can supplement both searching and sorting methods, but it can also be a burden and a headache. Do you tag both singular nouns and plural? What about synonyms? How much or little do you tag? These questions make tagging undesirable.</p>
<p>So if none of these methods are the answer, what is?</p>
<p><strong>Enter DEVONthink</strong></p>
<p>DEVONthink allows you to search, sort, and tag as much as desired, but more importantly, it creates relationships between your documents. It analyzes keywords, and over time, offers increasingly intelligent suggestions for related documents, as well as where to place the document in your organizational hierarchy.  While it can&#8217;t analyze the contents of every file, it does accept any file into its database. This effectively turns DEVONthink into a super-Finder; and DEVONthink databases are Spotlight friendly.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>An Example Workflow</strong></p>
<p>[[posterous-content:vJcgCiCcnwszfblJesim]]
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Use databases to separate your files. Separate databases are more portable than large, encompassing databases.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:gsrrBpsEHDkIcnzenEEh]]
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Use folders to separate contexts and smart folders to aggregate documents.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></em></p>
<p>[[posterous-content:fHweGqhchFfGlBCgAoyw]]
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Use tags to describe attributes that the analytics can not infer. An example would be describing departments or document statuses.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></em></p>
<p>[[posterous-content:cAzFBhazryCGrkltykau]]
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>See Also and Classify propose related documents and organizational locations for the selected document.</em></span></p>
<hr />
<p>Of course one can mix and match these methods to their liking, but having the power of analytics greatly saves on the time required to organize effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What methods have you found work well for you? What is your ideal method for&nbsp;digital organization?</p>

The search-don&#8217;t-sort method, where you throw things in generic folders such as Documents then search for them, proved too chaotic. It also discouraged browsing, which can remind one of forgotten documents as well as trigger new thoughts and concept</p>
<p>Meticulously sorting documents into folders is often too time consuming. While it is &#8220;browsing friendly&#8221;, it lacks flexibility. Does an article on historical fiction go under fiction, history, or writing?</p>
<p>Tagging can supplement both searching and sorting methods, but it can also be a burden and a headache. Do you tag both singular nouns and plural? What about synonyms? How much or little do you tag? These questions make tagging undesirable.</p>
<p>So if none of these methods are the answer, what is?</p>
<p><strong>Enter DEVONthink</strong></p>
<p>DEVONthink allows you to search, sort, and tag as much as desired, but more importantly, it creates relationships between your documents. It analyzes keywords, and over time, offers increasingly intelligent suggestions for related documents, as well as where to place the document in your organizational hierarchy.  While it can&#8217;t analyze the contents of every file, it does accept any file into its database. This effectively turns DEVONthink into a super-Finder; and DEVONthink databases are Spotlight friendly.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>An Example Workflow</strong></p>
<p>[[posterous-content:Ei7Z8dINmpaED8Z4NNRS]]</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Use databases to separate your files. Separate databases are more portable than large, encompassing databases.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:dNH5xeH9ZMPF2Vp0bMgT]]</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Use folders to separate contexts and smart folders to aggregate documents.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></em></p>
<p>[[posterous-content:s2XDyqsIM0e0mkBaLQCj]]</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Use tags to describe attributes that the analytics can not infer. An example would be describing departments or document statuses.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></em></p>
<p>[[posterous-content:u67TNQSYlW4iM0QB9hn7]]</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>See Also and Classify propose related documents and organizational locations for the selected document.</em></span></p>
<hr />
<p>Of course one can mix and match these methods to their liking, but having the power of analytics greatly saves on the time required to organize effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What methods have you found work well for you? What is your ideal method for&nbsp;digital organization?</p>

		<p> Want to quickly make a short URL using bit.ly and use LaunchBar? The script below should help you.</p>

<p>Unzip it and place it in ~/Library/Scripts, open the file, and replace &ldquo;USERNAME&rdquo; and &ldquo;APIKEY&rdquo; with your bit.ly username and api key. If the script doesn&rsquo;t show up in LaunchBar, you need to add the Scripts folder to your LaunchBar index. To do so:</p>

<ol>
<li>Activate LaunchBar</li>
<li>Click the gear</li>
<li>Go to Index &ndash;&gt; Show Index</li>
<li>Click the + in the bottom left</li>
<li>Add the folder ~/Library/Scripts</li>
</ol>


<p>From now on, any scripts you add to that folder will be indexed by LaunchBar.</p>

<p>To use the script:</p>

<ol>
<li>Activate LaunchBar</li>
<li>Begin typing part of the name of the script</li>
<li>Hit space</li>
<li>Paste your URL</li>
<li>Hit enter  Your shortened URL will automatically be copied to the clipboard!</li>
