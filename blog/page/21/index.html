		<p>The biotech company, Genetic Savings and Loan, will be refunding it&#8217;s customers $50,000 fees for having their cats cloned as they close their doors this year. After six years of research, the technology has not advanced enought to make cloning pets comercially viable.</p>
<p>For some this raises huge ethical debates. As cloning advances, it is only a matter of time before a human is cloned. Is cloning the wave of the future? Or is it as unethical as playing God?

		Recent reports claim that Verizon has been turning away new DSL customers due to over-capacity. Instead of increasing capacity to meet demand, Verizon has instead insisted on ending linesharing requirements or removing net neutrality to help them better meet demand. Aww, poor Verizon. It&#8217;s not bad enough that they lock out their phones. It&#8217;s not bad enough that they&#8217;re engineering their new fiber networks with the expectation that their bandwidth won&#8217;t fully be utilized. It&#8217;s not bad enough that they cancel users accounts if they saturate too much bandwidth.

Consider it a good thing that customers are getting turned away. They don&#8217;t have to put up with Verizon: The Evil Empire.

		On top of the slew of reasons why the PS3 will fail and will push Sony into chapter 11, Sony has recently ensured this final destination. While many PS2 games fell within the $40-$50 price range, many PS3 titles will be priced from $75-$100. In addition, the $100 price cut that Japan will see on the low-end PS3 model will not be offered outside that market. Some analysts feel that such a price cut is a sign of weakness.

Rumors have also been circulating regarding the PS3s DRM. Rumor has it that PS3 titles will be serialized and will lock down to the first console that they are played in, effectively eliminating the possibility of rentals. This also removes basic consumer rights, such as the ability to sell, trade, and loan PS3 titles. If such rumors prove to be true, Sony will have to rely on the ignorance of the average consumer in order to move consoles. With a $600 price tag I just don&#8217;t see that happening.

		The RIAA gets the honor of being the first corporation inducted into the Hall of Villains. Spanning reasons from their desire to strictly control a dated business model to the suing of their own customers, the RIAA never fails to make the headlines with the most absurd legal cases.

		Some things corporations do these days may make you roll your eyes. But then there are those that make you wonder if the executives within these companies graduated from a public school at the bottom of their class. Take the newest news, for instance, that the MPAA has acquired two dogs for the purpose of sniffing packages for burned DVDs. My dealer never told me there was a difference in scent. Next time I go buy DVDs from my dealer for the purpose of sniffing, I&#8217;ll be sure to point out how he&#8217;s been selling me the cheap stuff.

I bet Rin Tin Tin is rolling over in his grave.

		[[posterous-content:nJHlBJuuzErDDoqwjwcp]]Forget the black and white zunes, I want mine poop-colored. I love earthy tones, but this is rediculous. People with brown zunes are merely going to be the new target for playground and corporate bullies. With nearly every Microsoft product being a rehash of another already existing product, I guess this is how Microsoft felt it could achieve its solidarity in the portable media player marketplace. If at any point Apple felt threatened by the Zune, their fears have since been laid to rest.

		What is an Eflection?

Eflections are a combination of three components comprising one essence: reflection, inflection, and inspiration. They are intended to stir the mind into critical thinking, the heart into critical feeling, and the soul into critical being.

In the following articles you will find opinion, fact, and emotion. The journey into the evolution of the soul needs not to be a path walked alone, nor filled with hatred. As thus, I invite you to join me in finding truth. May your comments not mame, but inspire us to sift through the lies and find a source so pure, so true, so beautiful.

Welcome to the journey.
