		I must extoll my excitement for the new &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; film. Join me after the jump for the trailer and my commentary on the upcoming film.

It&#8217;s been six years since the last Star Trek film titled, &#8220;Nemesis&#8221;. While I enjoyed Nemesis, the Star Trek films have never been so epic until now. Hinted at in &#8220;First Contact&#8221; when Picard mentions the importance of humanity discovering alien life for the first time, the scale and magnitude of Star Trek seems to finally be apprehended in the upcoming flick by J. J. Abrams.

This trailer is truly stirring. The opening sequence teases you by making you think it&#8217;s something it&#8217;s not, but when you hear, &#8220;My name&#8217;s James Tiberius Kirk&#8221;, you can&#8217;t help but get that chill that says, &#8220;It&#8217;s here.&#8221; The trailer then begins to set the atmosphere of the film: Kirk, a lost man, looking to find his place in the world. Spock, a man of two worlds. I really hope that this film delivers on character development as Kirk and Spock are two of the most well known science fiction characters of all time.

Action ensues, and you can&#8217;t help but become excited at Abram&#8217;s cinematic approach to the piece. Swooping cameras, dolly-twists, and beautiful visuals set this film up to be a true work of art. While I&#8217;ve grown up a Star Wars fan and not a trekkie, I have always enjoyed and appreciated Star Trek &#8211; especially Star Trek&#8217;s diplomatic emphasis as opposed to Star War&#8217;s &#8220;cool factor.&#8221; This film may convert me to a trekkie.

Move over Star Wars prequels. This is how you resurrect a legacy.

		I finally have a good start to my first animation.

I have been wanting to do an animation for some time. Unfortunately, like with many of my aspirations, it was put on the back burner. I began talking about it more regularly again a couple months ago &#8211; brainstorming, conceptualizing. I had ideas for certain elements, but I wasn&#8217;t sure how to start the story.

It came to me last night while I was at a bar with some friends in Chicago. I was sitting by myself as I was really tired and didn&#8217;t want to talk to anyone. I pulled out my moleskine, and with pen in hand, it began.

I&#8217;m pretty excited about it. I&#8217;m not ready to reveal any details other than this: it will be 2D. I feel that this particular perspective will be best for capturing the essence of this piece.

Stay tuned. The future begins&#8230;

Now. (<em>Baloop!</em>)

		My sin is Envy. Envy, jade green with desire, she teases me. Like lust for the flesh, I crave that which I can not have. To hide from her allure, I have cloaked myself with disappointment and despair. Sacrificing my passions on an alter of flames, I rend my soul in a frail attempt to satiate her appetite for my misery.

One step closer.

Things seem different. Envy&#8217;s allure is less seductive, and I begin to empathize with her. Her once coy looks are now more indifferent. I find myself less guarded. Surely this is one of her ploys; but I can&#8217;t resist.

Two steps closer.

Her beauty is striking, but she seems insecure. Her once devilish charm has been replaced with a countenance of sorrow. Where I once saw a shade, I now see a woman. A hint of emotion in her eyes  ignites a revelation in me &#8211; she&#8217;s my antecedent!

Within arms reach.

She breaks. Her once enchanting eyes have been replaced by streams of resignation and remorse. Her voice breaks as she tells me her story.

As a child she lived in reverie. Desiring a life driven by her passions, she cared not what this world demanded of her. She knew not failure nor envy, for she saw all failures as a test of endurance, envy as the plunderer of dreams.

But as she grew into a woman she put aside her childish ways &#8211; including that of her child-like wonder. Where she once embraced diligence, she rested in the arms of enervation. Where she once was fueled by passion, she was extinguished by apathy. Where she once immersed herself in hope, she bathed in the recessions of despair.

She sobs.

Why then entice me with such a sad, desolate life?

She whispers. I have what she could have had: potential. If she could lure me into her trap, if she could make me like her, she could find solace in my then dismal existence. Despondent, she sold her soul to the Great Void to become the very thing she abhorred &#8211; Envy.

I think I get it now. I weep for her&#8230;

As I begin to walk away, I reflect on her sad, but inspiring, story. I hear something. As I look over my should, there she is, laughing. She looks up, her eyes enchanting once again, but this time she gives me a warm smile. I truly get it now.

Envy is not my sin. Envy is my impetus for transcendence. She is my warden. It is through her persistent conflict that I am taught courage, perseverance, diligence. It is because of her that my passions are defined.

I know not envy.

		There&#8217;s something that speaks to all of us. It lies within us, that inner voice. Some call it ego, others call it God. It matters not what you call it &#8211; you must acknowledge it.

To hear this inner voice, sometimes you must shroud yourself from external influences. Use these external influences for inspiration and reflection, but do not let them guide you. It is only this inner voice that knows what you truly want. When you nourish this inner voice, the distractions and envy of those and the world around you begin to fade; what emerges &#8211; an individual embraced with identity, able to give back to those who inspired them to aspire.

I have been a ghost in a shell. This shell of blood, this shell of flesh, I have held ambitions, aspirations, and dreams; yet like a ghost, I have remained hollow and transparent. Others have seen this in me. Others have seen my untapped potential and have prodded me to take up my mantle, lighting my own path.

That light I have known not.

                                            Until now.

I greet you with open arms as a new man. A new perspective I have embraced, transforming me in ways I have only dreamt of. A new identity forged from trials and tribulations so mentally aggressive that I have considered changing my name to reflect my new found being.

Where before I walked in the shade of others, I now cast my own shadow. The darkness knows itself intimately. Hiding in darkness out of fear and frailty can not produce a shroud of influence to blanket those around you. You must stand in the light to cast your shadow.

		Writing is therapy for me. Like many who require therapy, I don&#8217;t submit to it enough. It teases me at a distance, playfully hoping that one day I will catch it, but in the mean time, remains just out of reach.

She remains just out of reach.

I see her in my mind. Shapeshifting, she confuses me. She eludes me. Do I know her? Probably not. Will I? I fear&#8230;

Nothing&#8230;. and yet everything.

Who am I, and what am I saying? My friends don&#8217;t know me. If they only knew the life I lived in the shadows. If only those who knew my life in the shadows knew of my life in the light.

I&#8217;m torn in two, woven together by the threads of sanity. But what a frail sanity that is.

Fuck you.

You know who you are. You&#8217;re reading this right now. You&#8217;re&#8230; writing this right now.

I don&#8217;t hate who I could be. I hate who I am. With every new day, I look at the past and think, &#8220;At least I&#8217;m not who I was then.&#8221; Yet a small part of me misses that old me. It&#8217;s a co-dependency &#8211; I must dismiss it.

Anyways, tomorrow will be the start of the new year. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s already 2055. According to the death calender, this will be the year of my passing. What can I claim as accomplishments in my life? Upon reflection, will I mourn my failures to invoke my dreams? Or will I rejoice with what I have done for my family, my friends, myself?

I&#8217;ll have to give this more thought &#8211; tomorrow.

		<strong>Beyond Belief</strong>

I&#8217;m almost done with, &#8220;The God Delusion&#8221; by Richard Dawkins, and I must say, I can&#8217;t put it down.

I&#8217;ve been questioning my beliefs a lot over the past few years. This year I began listening to a Buddhist podcast on Zen, and recently, my faith in Christianity. I went through this about a year ago but regressed to Christianity out of comfort. Here I am again, only this time I&#8217;m finding my belief in the Christian God waning.

To summarize my beliefs: I think there could be a God, I just don&#8217;t know who the fuck He is. I believe in evolution, and I&#8217;m living my life as if it&#8217;s the only one I have. Like my friend Patrick said, life is too short to waste mental power on an afterlife. If there is an afterlife, I&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised providing that the God of the Bible is not real, and I don&#8217;t find myself in Hell.

<strong>Consequence</strong>

A side effect of my waning belief in the Christian God is a waxing awareness of the present. I feel more alive &#8211; lucky to belief alive that is. This enhanced awareness of the present has affected me in both big and little ways, from a newfound drive to what I want to do with my life, to an acuteness of the senses when I&#8217;m on my motorcycle.

An additional consequence is a greater desire for time management. Life is too short. I don&#8217;t have time to fuck around. Thus, things have got to go. I&#8217;m reminded of a blog post by the lovely <a href="http://www.gwenbell.com">Gwen Bell</a> titled, &#8221;<a href="http://www.gwenbell.com/2008/03/24/if-you-cant-pitch-it-ditch-it/">If You Can&#8217;t Pitch It, Ditch It</a>&#8221;. Gwen describes a man she met that lived life by a stopwatch in order manage his time. It sounds extreme, but I get it now: life is too short to fuck around. A stopwatch was this man&#8217;s way of making efficient use of his time. This man would even evaluate his friendships, and call them off if they weren&#8217;t beneficial. While that may a bit harsh for my tastes, the point is that I need to make efficient use of my time.


Once I&#8217;ve finished &#8220;The God Delusion&#8221;, I&#8217;m going to read it through a second time and take notes. With these notes, I&#8217;ll post my thoughts as well as a full review on the book.

		OpenID is a great way to simplify the authentication and registration process. Using SSL, you can make authentication even easier by no longer requiring a password to login.

If you use <a href="http://myopenid.com">MyOpenID.com</a> as your OpenID provider, login at <a href="http://myopenid.com">MyOpenID.com</a>, go to &#8220;Account Settings&#8221;, then &#8220;Authentication Settings&#8221;. Under &#8220;Add an SSL Client Certificate&#8221;, enter a name for the computer your on and click, &#8220;Create Certificate&#8221;. This will install a SSL certificate in your browser that will automatically identify you when visiting <a href="http://myopenid.com">MyOpenID.com</a>.

A word of advise, do not use this method on a public or shared computer. Anyone that has access to your computer will have access to your <a href="http://myopenid.com">MyOpenID.com</a> account.

What I can do is cut my losses. Unfortunately, the person formerly in charge of the domain paid for the year in full. We&#8217;ll have to cut our losses as we move to other providers &#8211; providers that are competent.
