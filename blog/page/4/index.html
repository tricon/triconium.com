    <p>The &#8220;self-help&#8221; books I love are the ones that aren&#8217;t trying to help or guide you directly but are simply giving insights.

<p>When you <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/how-to-choose-a-telescope-110127.html">look up at the night sky</a> &#8211; whether with the naked eye or with your spiffy Celestron telescope &#8211; how often do you stop to consider which chemical elements might be present in their gassy glow? Astronomers use several different methods to study how different chemicals emit and absorb radiation inside stars (and even black holes), but they get widely varying results.</p>

<p>Now astronomers think they might have a new technique for doing so, with an added bonus: it could also lead to a potential new cancer radiation treatment capable of precisely targeting tumors without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue. Sultana Nahar of Ohio State University <a href="http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/astrotherapy.htm" target="_self">described the research</a> at the International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy in June.</p>

After watching all three videos I&#8217;ve got to say that these guys have some real passion towards their chosen craft: the perfect cup of coffee or tea. You can hear it in the way they talk, in the way they work, their equipment, the website for the shop, etc. Everything down to the smallest bit is carefully crafted and thought through before the trigger is ever pulled. I myself can&#8217;t do their passion justice by talking about it so I&#8217;m just going to end it here and let you watch the videos and see for yourself.</p></blockquote>

		<p>When FaceTime debuted months ago, it came with a price: $1. One dollar is nothing for such a useful application, but many wondered why Apple was charging for it.</p>

<p>Around this time, Xcode 4 was released. It too came with a cost: $5 if you did not have a paid Apple developer account, free if you did. Since Xcode had always been free regardless, many wondered what exactly Apple was up to with some speculating that they were attempting to push developers towards paid accounts.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://triconium.com/on-the-cost-of-facetime-and-xcode-4">On the Cost of FaceTime and Xcode 4</a>, I argued that it is in Apple&rsquo;s best interest that Xcode remain free:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>While $5 for Xcode is nothing compare to what Microsoft charges for Visual Studio, I feel that it is in Apple&rsquo;s best interest that these applications be free. At the price of free, Apple is bolstered as an enabler of their own platforms. At the price of free, their paid developer programs are further promoted through zero-risk use of their tools.</p></blockquote>

<p>FaceTime is now included with Lion for free. Xcode 4.1 is now free and available on the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>Perhaps Apple saw these costs as early-access fees. Maybe they were just testing the waters, seeing how much they could get away with. Regardless, I am pleased that Apple has reversed this decision by including FaceTime for free to all users of Lion and promoting its excellent platforms, APIs, and tools through making Xcode free once again.</p>

<p>While Apple, and any company for that matter, has the right to defend their property and should, this situation serves as a grim reminder as to just how out of control the patent system is.</p>
