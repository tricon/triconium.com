Back in the late 1980s when <a href="http://www.janesaddiction.com/">Jane&#8217;s Addiction</a> was in its prime, I saw an interview where front man Perry Farrell was asked about sales figures for their albums. His response: &#8220;If I wanted to sell records, I&#8217;d work in a record store.&#8221; He knew that the key to success was touring, which the band did almost incessantly for about three years.

<p>
Flash forward 20 years, and it&#8217;s harder than ever for artists to make a living selling CDs. According to <a href="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2009/10/future-of-music-summit-115000-albums-and-only-110-hits.html">a report</a> in the Chicago Tribune, a speaker at the Future of Music Coalition gave a breakdown of album numbers that will be particularly shocking to young independent bands who hoped they&#8217;d be able to make a living selling discs. More than 115,000 new albums were released in the U.S. last year. Of those, 110  sold more than 250,000 copies in the U.S. last year&#8211;that&#8217;s not such a surprise, as big stars have always been rare. But only 1,500 titles cracked the 10,000 mark, and fewer than 6,000 sold a paltry 1,000 copies. 
</p>
<p>
To give you some idea what 1,000 copies means, that used to be the standard manufacturing run for self-produced CDs. Indie bands imagined that they would use a hundred or so discs for publicity&#8211;sending them to radio stations and reviewers, for instance&#8211;and then sell the rest to local fans and on tour. Selling 900 CDs at $12 a pop would gross almost $11,000, which would be enough to cover low-budget recording and manufacturing expenses and perhaps buy some new guitar pedals and drumheads. Nobody makes a living selling 1,000 CDs. (Nowadays, bands can order reasonably priced smaller runs from companies like <a href="http://www.discmakers.com/SelfServiceQuoter/">Disc Makers</a>, and even use manufacturing-on-demand from services like <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-10151957-27.html">Audiolife</a> and Amazon&#8217;s <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-10194355-27.html">CreateSpace</a>.) 
</p>
<p>
What about 10,000 discs? If you&#8217;re just starting out, making over $100,000 from CD sales sounds like a dream. Of course, you have to split that money among the band members, and anybody else who gets a cut, like the producer and manager. And if you&#8217;re signed to a label, you might already be that deep into the hole for your advance and recording expenses, so forget about royalties and just hope they&#8217;ll pay you an advance for the next one. At 10,000 copies, you&#8217;re probably getting a little radio play somewhere, so you might earn a few small paychecks from publishing royalties, and if you&#8217;ve got a good live act and are willing to tour endlessly, you might be able to sell more tickets than CDs over the course of a year. So perhaps 10,000 is the low-end baseline for making a living playing music. 
</p>
<p>
 Of the new titles released last year, almost 99 percent of them didn&#8217;t sell enough copies to let their creators earn a living from CD sales, and almost 95 percent of them didn&#8217;t sell enough copies to cover the most basic expenses involved in their recording.
</p>
<p>
You still think your unsigned band&#8217;s good enough to be in that slim line? Remember that these figures include CDs released by well-established artists like Bob Dylan and new artists who are the lucky recipients of massive publicity pushes by major labels. 
</p>
<p>
For an unknown band just starting out? Better polish those chops and gas up the van, then get ready to live on ramen noodles for a couple years. And don&#8217;t worry about devaluing your recordings by selling them cheap or giving them away&#8211;worry about getting enough fans to hear them so they&#8217;ll be interested in coming to your shows, and dragging a few friends with them.
