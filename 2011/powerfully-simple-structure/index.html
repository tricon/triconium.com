	<div class="entry-content"><h2>Simplicity</h2>

<p>About every three months or so, I fall into &ldquo;ADD&rdquo; regarding some aspect of my life or workflow. Often it is in regard to text editors. Vim? Emacs? TextMate? Aptana? Choices! They stress me out.</p>

<p>I always come back to simplicity. While I still use Vim quite often, I find myself returning to TextMate again and again. It&rsquo;s so simple, so easy to configure. I could say the same of Xcode. Is it heavier than TextMate? By far, but clicking a button to have a project built, deployed, and run is simple.</p>

<p>Simplicity.</p>

<p>I recently went through this with organizational methods. I&rsquo;ve tried the GTD approach before, and while I admire David Allen and his method, the only aspect that ever stuck with me was that of contexts. I find GTD to be a bit <em>too</em> structured for me due to its overhead.</p>

<p>A while back I started using a free app called Pomodoro for working in twenty-five minute sprints. I would sometimes combine this with SelfControl to limit my access to certain websites during the sprint. I enjoyed the work-break model that this afforded me and recently have begun embracing the Pomodoro Technique fully.</p>

<p>Just before I purchased a book called, &ldquo;The Pomodoro Technique Illustrated&rdquo;, I hesitated as I thought, &ldquo;Does this really merit a book? It&rsquo;s just twenty-five minute sprints, right?&rdquo; Instead, I found the additional instruction useful. The Pomodoro Technique does require additional work but not much. I find the Activity Inventory inviting as it allows me to brain dump my to-dos. Using the To Do Today list, I decide at the beginning of each day what I will tackle. I consciously accept that I will not work on the rest. Logging internal and external interruptions seems tedious, but you begin to realize that it&rsquo;s a form of psychological punishment for allowing yourself to be distracted. It can also reveal patterns in your schedule that can aid in further structuring your day to avoid common interruptions. Finally, voiding a Pomodoro is the ultimate punishment. It&rsquo;s not so much time wasted as it is a reminder to stay completely focused for those twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>I began using pen and paper as the author suggested. More than once he said to do so as it allows you to easily modify your tracking and reporting. This is true, but I just can&rsquo;t do it. I love handwriting, but I obsess so much over my poor handwriting that I am prevented from writing. Instead of enjoying the writing process, instead of listening to the muse and embracing the words, I dread writing due to my obsessive compulsive nature.</p>

<p>I found an app called Pomodoro App for iPad on the App Store and have found it to be a near-complete Pomodoro solution. Something just feels right about pressing the start and break buttons. Seeing the timer tick, hearing it tick, being able to quickly and easily load up my Activity Inventory, To Do Today list, and log interruptions, these features allow me to focus even more on just getting things done. I no longer have to stress over scraps of paper and poor handwriting. I just do.</p>

<p>Here I am in iA Writer typing away. This application has zero options. You can&rsquo;t even change the font. There is nothing to get in my way even though it has additional, powerful features such as Markdown support and HTML export. But guess what: the application does not make the artist. Great tools do not define their artists, they enable them. Using iA Writer does not make me a better writer. It doesn&rsquo;t make me write more. It&rsquo;s not a magic bullet for kicking the anti-writing bug. It enables me. It allows me to flow with no interruptions or potential distractions. I must decide to do. iA Writer defines the how.</p>

<p>Do you know what TextMate, Pomodoro, and iA Writer all have in common? They are simple. They are powerfully simple.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>Tick, tick, tick. The Pomodoro timer ticks away. It gives me rhythm. That&rsquo;s what the Pomodoro Technique is all about â€” rhythm. Work, break, work, break. Type, stretch, code, coffee. Rhythm. For some time I have felt that I have needed structure, yet the thought of fully embracing the left or the right, this or that, stresses me out to no end. It goes against the grain of who I am. It undermines my call to spontaneity. Yet, pure spontaneity often leaves me wanting more structure as I struggle to accomplish. There is a balance, and I have found it. It lies in powerfully simple structure.</p>

<p>I can see these patterns now. I can see why I like what I do. This has been within me all along, buried within, and it hasn&rsquo;t been until now, until I took the time to write about it, that I was able to see the &ldquo;why&rdquo;. It feels good. It feels good to write. It feels good to know a little more about myself, to be a little more defined.</p>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t we all seeking identity in some form? I am. Like a swaying pendulum, I have met both extremes. I am finally coming to rest somewhere towards the middle. Writing is my outlet. I shall defeat Resistance and embrace it. I shall write more. I shall speak my mind more. I shall be right more. I shall be wrong far more often. I shall be egotistical and humble, crude and supportive, spiteful and loving, weak and strong. I shall be.</p>
