<p>Operating systems have evolved greatly in the past twenty years, and yet in many ways, they have still been tied to their old paradigms. Mac OS X Lion changes this. Raising the bar and setting a new standard for operating systems yet again, Apple takes the art of operating system design and innovation further into the 21st century with auto-save, versioning, resume, and more.</p>

<h4>Auto-Save</h4>

<p>You&rsquo;re working on your Microsoft Word document. You&rsquo;ve heard of auto-save. You may have even used it before when the power went out and Word brought your document back as it was prior to the crash. What you may not realize is that there are only two working versions of your document at any given time: the one you manually save and the auto-save copy. Whenever you recover via auto-save, the auto-save feature continues to overwrite its auto-save copy and you must manually save permanent changes.</p>

<p>As you&rsquo;re working on your document, you reach a point where you&rsquo;d like to try a couple different directions. We&rsquo;ll call this the fork snapshot. You make a copy of the document â€” copy A for one direction and copy B for the other. A few hours go by, but you realize that you don&rsquo;t really like copy A or copy B. You&rsquo;d like to go back to that fork snapshot. You&rsquo;ve changed a lot of text in both copies, and at the same time, you&rsquo;d like to keep a few of the changes from copy A and copy B. How do you get back to that fork snapshot? You now have a compound, time-consuming problem.</p>

<p><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-03-09/rrEontjrcqAomlpkpDEbajxkEFuagJfqlcGGhBqFHBaFurwogIoyqbfjJpdD/The-Problem.png?content_part=pid___0" alt="Lion's Versioning" /></p>

<p>Up to this point in the history of operating systems, you would have needed to have saved multiple copies of each document throughout your workflow. This would only serve to make the aforementioned issues even more compound. You would then have to navigate all of these files, copying and pasting between them, and you still would not be able to revert to the fork snapshot without rewriting lost or changed text unless you explicitly saved a copy at that time.</p>

<h4>Lion&rsquo;s Auto-Versioning</h4>

<p>Mac OS X Lion does not auto-save to a separate copy as described above. It <strong>auto-versions</strong> the actual file you are working on. It does this automatically whenever you open a file and for every hour that the file is open. What is versioning? Whereas traditional auto-saving saves a complete copy of the file, versioning efficiently saves snapshots of the file by saving only the changes that were made. These changes are saved within the file itself, so when you transfer, move, or copy the file, every snapshot of that file comes with it.</p>

<p>With Lion&rsquo;s auto-versioning, you no longer have to remember to make multiple copies and you no longer have multiple copies eating up space on your Mac. And while traditional revert file features can only revert the document to the last time it was saved, Lion lets you quickly revert the document to the last time it was opened. What about the previous issue with merging changes? With versioning, you can pull up the changes side by side and simply copy or drag over the changes you want to keep, from any version of that file throughout the history of its creation.</p>

<p><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-03-09/vCAasfnlDdAcwghlJzqbhoIyhsFaaCbABIoDCcFxeCnlnowBBeqqcGyskoFo/Lion-Versioning.png?content_part=pid___1" alt="Lion's Versioning" /></p>

<p>Software developers know first hand the crucial importance of versioning. Now you too can benefit from this system without any additional effort or thought.</p>

<h4>Resume</h4>

<p>Have you ever needed to close an application to save resources for a more intensive task? Ever had to close all of your apps to restart your computer or simply quit an application because you were done with it? Recall what a burden it was when you needed to return to that application only to have to navigate back to the photo you were working on, to reopen two documents you were working on side-by-side, or to reopen the browser tabs to the pages you were previously viewing. Mac OS X Lion&rsquo;s Resume abolishes this annoying monstrosity. With Resume, your applications open exactly as they were before the application was quit. Notice how the Dock no longer shows a running application indicator.</p>

<p>GEEK NOTE: OS X already does intelligent resource allocation. What is to be determined is if Mac OS X Lion has done away with the concept of running applications as Apple did with their iOS devices. While this concept exists technically in terms of running or exited processes, to the user, an iOS app is either on the screen or it isn&rsquo;t. The user is not aware that iOS actually terminates applications when it needs more resources for others. This entire process is transparent because iOS applications resume nearly instantly as they were when reopened. OS X Lion could very well do the same. With SSDs becoming increasingly prevalent, the ability to resume an OS X application nearly instantly from a completely quit state is certainly possible.</p>

<h4>The Rest</h4>

<p>Mac OS X Lion offers much more than these three improvements. New features like Mission Control and Launchpad further refine the already excellent OS X user interface. AirDrop makes file sharing simple and elegant while Mail 5 brings a sleek new UI and an intelligent email threading system akin to Gmail&rsquo;s. New and refined gestures and animations make interacting with your Mac more fluid and natural than ever, with the <a href="http://triconium.com/the-art-of-unitasking/">Art of Unitasking</a> promoted by a new, system-wide Fullscreen API that enables developers to create richer, fullscreen applications. And Mac OS X Server is no longer a separate product. It is now updated and included in Mac OS X Lion, freely available for every Lion user to leverage.</p>

<h4>Unparalleled</h4>

<p>Apple continues to show that it is unparalleled in innovation, elegance, and attention to detail. They continue to push technology forward while refusing to give into complexity. Where others would allow user interface and user experience to suffer, Apple refuses to settle for good, choosing instead to strive for great. To see what lies ahead, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/">visit the official Mac OS X Lion page</a>. And do watch the gestures and animation demo to appreciate the precision, fluidity, and attention to detail that Apple affords to all of its products and services.</p>

<p>Mac OS X Lion arrives this Summer.</p>
