<p>Today, MacBook Pros are supposed to get Intel's Light Peak, a.k.a. "Thunderbolt". Here is a comparison of Light Peak to USB 3.0:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong>: Light Peak sports two 10 Gbps channels.</p>

<p>USB 3.0:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>5 Gbps (theoretical 14 Gbps)</p></li>
<li><p>Full duplex (same speed in both directions at the same time)</p></li>
<li><p>Backwards compatible with USB 2.0</p></li>
<li><p>Power and data</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Light Peak:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>10 Gbps (Theoretical 100 Gbps) per channel</p></li>
<li><p>Two channels</p></li>
<li><p>Full duplex (same speed in both directions at the same time)</p></li>
<li><p>Power and data</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-protocol (This is huge)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The big sell of USB 3.0 is backwards compatibility, but Light Peak's multi-protocol ability is huge. This means Light Peak can actually run USB 3.0, HDMI, streaming protocols, video protocols, network protocols, and more, all at the same time across the same channel. This demonstration shows USB 3.0, Blu-ray, and a file transfer being done simultaneously across a single connection to the computer.</p>

<p>For those with copious USB external hard drives, USB 3.0 is a nice move forward and will be very successful due to its backwards compatibility alone. In terms of next generation buses, however, Light Peak is king. Its higher throughput and ability to run multiple-protocols, including USB 3.0, affords it the best of all worlds.</p>
