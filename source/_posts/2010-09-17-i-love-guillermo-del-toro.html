<p>Guillermo Del Toro on <em>At the Mountains of Madness</em>:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>&ldquo;We are budgeting the creatures and met with Spectral Motion and ILM, where Dennis Muren told me the sweetest words ever when he said, no one has ever seen monsters like this. That was truly one of the highlights of my fat life, a demigod like Muren saying that.&rdquo; ~ Guillermo Del Toro</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;One of the highlights of my fat life&hellip;&rdquo; Love it!</p>
