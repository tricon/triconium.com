It is 4:07 AM, and I am sitting in the office all alone. Not a hint of daylight in sight, the sky is beaconed by street lights, and towers pulsing as if calling out to some unknown entity light-years away.

Paranoid, I can not find peace in music as doing so would cloud my senses, making myself prone to those who would dare sneak up behind me.

Yes, this moment is dark, yet there is something beautiful about it as well. I imagine myself the last man on earth, left to explore a world in which cities run themselves. Not a foreigner in a strange land, but a man in the place he calls home; silent chaos in the world he sees everyday when he opens his eyes. This city -- autonomous. Yet, I know I must plan my travels carefully as there is limited supply of fuel to carry me from town to town.

The sun is gone; a mystery left to be resolved. This planet -- forever dark. All alone, forever night, I am left to experience and remember the lives of those that once gave this world life. Life still exists through the plants and the trees, but all mammals have gone. To where, I do not know.

In solitude, I feel immortal.
