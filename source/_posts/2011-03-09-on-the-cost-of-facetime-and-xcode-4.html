title: On the Cost of FaceTime and Xcode 4
published: true

<p>A few weeks ago, Apple released FaceTime on the Mac App Store for $0.99. Today Apple released the long awaited Xcode 4 for $4.99 or free for members of the iOS or Mac Developer Programs. Historically Xcode has been free. Why is Apple now charging for such tools?</p>
<p>I suspect that Apple is testing the waters. <p /> If the backlash is fierce enough, we may discover that Lion includes FaceTime and Xcode for free. In this case, the costs of these applications become an early access fee for versions of OS X they very well could have left behind. <p /> Apple could stand to learn from Gary Vaynerchuk's, "The Thank You Economy". While $5 for Xcode is nothing compare to what Microsoft charges for Visual Studio, I feel that it is in Apple's best interest that these applications be free. At the price of free, Apple is bolstered as an enabler of their own platforms. At the price of free, their paid developer programs are further promoted through zero-risk use of their tools.</p>
