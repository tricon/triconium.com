<p>I am in the middle of a personal, social evolution. In my quest to be a more confident leader, and to increase my skills with dialogue and people, I have been more forward in regards to approaching strangers and striking up conversation.</p>
<p />
<div>This means, of course, that I am going to fail a lot before I get considerably better. But with a sense of humor and a willingness to learn from my mistakes, I can only succeed. Here is a tale of one such failure.</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>A couple nights ago I was at Boltini. I see this pretty, blonde girl wearing what appears to be a deep red, velvet Santa hat. Thinking I can use her hat as an opener I say,</div>
<p />
<div>"Are you promoting Christmas early? Because Thanksgiving hasn't even arrived yet."&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>She gives me a classic, WTF look. Her male friend starts laughing and says, "It's not a Santa hat!"</div>
<p />
<div>I respond, "I apologize. I've had a few drinks," and eject.</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>I didn't feel embarrassed. I couldn't help but laugh... and learn.</div>
