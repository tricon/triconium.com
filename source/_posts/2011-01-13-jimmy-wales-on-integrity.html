<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<strong>Do you get tired of defending the integrity of Wikipedia articles? How do you counter the criticism?</strong>
<br />
<p>No, I don't really get tired of it, because I think that our responsibility to help make Wikipedia as good as it possibly can be means that we have to take seriously every legitimate criticism and think about how we can improve.</p>

While it is unwise to challenge all of one's critics, it is still important to consider their words. Be slow to speak, eager to listen. Integrity and wisdom derive from these things.
