<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Remember when you first heard stuff like how either Steam or <a href="http://www.1up.com/games/pc/starcraft-2-wings-liberty">StarCraft 2</a> require you to be online for authentication purposes? That the process to play or utilize either service offline can be a bit circuitous, but at least it's still possible to be offline. But, <a href="http://www.1up.com/games/pc/diablo-3">Diablo 3</a> differs in that you must be online to play at all -- not just for authentication.</blockquote>
