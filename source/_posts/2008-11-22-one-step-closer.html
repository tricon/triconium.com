I finally have a good start to my first animation.

I have been wanting to do an animation for some time. Unfortunately, like with many of my aspirations, it was put on the back burner. I began talking about it more regularly again a couple months ago -- brainstorming, conceptualizing. I had ideas for certain elements, but I wasn't sure how to start the story.

It came to me last night while I was at a bar with some friends in Chicago. I was sitting by myself as I was really tired and didn't want to talk to anyone. I pulled out my moleskine, and with pen in hand, it began.

I'm pretty excited about it. I'm not ready to reveal any details other than this: it will be 2D. I feel that this particular perspective will be best for capturing the essence of this piece.

Stay tuned. The future begins...

Now. (<em>Baloop!</em>)
