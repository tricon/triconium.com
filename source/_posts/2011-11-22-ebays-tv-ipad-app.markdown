> Users tap “Watch with eBay” and type in their zip code, cable provider, channel and the program they are currently watching; and using show and event-specific key word searches, the app will surface relevant merchandise from the more than 200 million listings available on the eBay marketplace.

Very interesting idea. While I find the idea of using an iPad while watching TV distracting, providing it's a show I care about, it's good to see eBay thinking outside of the box, transending mediums to promote its service through potentially useful features.
