<p>We have all heard, used, and believed stereotypes. Some have made us laugh. Others have made us wince.&nbsp;Yet there is a stereotype that is being lived out everyday on TV and in politics. It is sad and pathetic.</p>
<p />
<div>It is the Republican stereotype.</div>
<p />
<div>What is the Republican stereotype?</div>
<p />
<div>Without diving into every aspect of it, I will focus on one of the most common attributes,&nbsp;one that many of my right-leaning friends elicit: cynicism.</div>
<p />
<div>They bitch, moan, complain, slander, and verbally rend progressives seeking positive change. Yet when confronted with an inquiry for a solution, they are ill equipped to volley.</div>
<p />
<div>The most disgusting of these attacks is in the form of extreme mockery. Satire is a clever, humorous, informative approach. But the extreme mockery that many Republicans have resorted to recently, whether in the form of relating Obama to Hitler in <em>any</em> way, discreetly or remotely mocking him as our "savior", or making bigoted, racist remarks towards him or others allied with him, is nothing short of repulsive, disgusting, and in no way tolerable.</div>
<p />
<div>Pathetic.</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>It sickens me to see these lower class and middle class people "fervently" opposing, on behalf of a for-profit healthcare industry, a bill that they will likely one day require. In this spiteful stupor, they berate healthcare reform proponents with sadistic rage, some stooping so low as to recede to a dialect not commonly accepted since the 1950s. From where does such malevolence derive?</div>
<p />
<div>My friend Anna said it best, "In any debate of this kind, there is a party that seeks to aid as many people as possible; then there is the party that looks to find those that do not deserve it."</div>
<p />
<div>How despicable that one would even think of withholding the right to life from another. The right speaks so much of the sanctity of life, yet they are quick to execute those on death row, taking innocents in the process, while lobbying against an individual's right to live a full life enhanced and aided by healthcare.</div>
<p />
<div>Does. Not. Compute.</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>Some Republicans will say, "Oh, but I'm not like them." Good. My suggestion: find another party; or make damn clear that you do not associate with these hate-reapers.</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>"Republicans have had years to reform healthcare and did nothing."</div>
<p />
<div>This is a common theme on Twitter at this moment as the healthcare vote concludes. Hindsight is 20/20. It is easy to cry foul now, but you Republicans blew it. You had your chance. The passing of the healthcare bill may be a small step in the right direction, but at least&nbsp;<em>something</em> is finally being done.</div>
<p />
<div>I am thankful.</div>
