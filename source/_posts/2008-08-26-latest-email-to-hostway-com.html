And the latest email to Hostway.com, after they said that they had forwarded my request to second tier support, and would reply to me soon:


<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Alright guys, seriously...

Is this a joke, or is Hostway.com just a big, fat joke in and of itself? (I'm going to go with the latter).

This is such a simple request, and it's not rocket science. Eight days without a reply... seriously?

Wow... I can't even begin to describe how shitty your service has been. I know I'm being a dick about this, but apparently that's what it takes to get support from you.

Even a simply reply saying, "We can't get to your issue at this time because we're engineering new ways to screw our customers," would be better than nothing. Hell I'd give you props for having some balls.

See you in another eight days!
