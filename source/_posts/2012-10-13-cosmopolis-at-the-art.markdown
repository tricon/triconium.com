I just saw David Cronenberg's, “Cosmopolis” at the Art theater. I am centered.

Combined with the inspirations offered by witnessing Philippe Petit in person three times this week, I am peaceful in being… Me… Perhaps, however I feel "in the moment" is a better choice of words. I am liberated.

Be weird.

While watching Cronenberg's, “Cosmopolis”, I had a further centering moment. When Packard is walking up the stairs, gun in hand, towards Richard's apartment, I was there. I was the director. I was David Cronenberg. I could see the ACs, the DP, the cinematographers — the entire crew. I felt what it would be to direct such a film.

I felt at home.
