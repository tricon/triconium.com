>I'm cruising Vimeo the other day and decided to do a search for barista's and see what comes up. The first video I come across is one done by <a href="http://vimeo.com/thed4d" title="The D4D" target="_blank">The D4D</a> and it's a three part series on coffee filmed at <a href="http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/" title="Intelligentsia Coffee &amp; Tea" target="_blank">Intelligentsia Coffee &amp; Tea</a> in Venice, California. After watching all three videos I've got to say that these guys have some real passion towards their chosen craft: the perfect cup of coffee or tea. You can hear it in the way they talk, in the way they work, their equipment, the website for the shop, etc. Everything down to the smallest bit is carefully crafted and thought through before the trigger is ever pulled. I myself can't do their passion justice by talking about it so I'm just going to end it here and let you watch the videos and see for yourself.

Absolutely beautiful. I adore these people's passion. As a coffee lover, I have to visit this place some day.
