My life will radically change for the better this year. This coming July, the lease on my apartment will end. I will be faced with a few options: I can renew the lease, relocate within Champaign, move in with Andrew and Stephanie in Springfield, move in with Nathan Philips in Springfield, move home, or relocate out of state.

For some time I have wanted to move to Austin, TX. Its center as a music, technology, and film hub has always excited me. I must say, though, that LA has attractive elements as well. Hollywood creates an atmosphere of opportunity with the rush of traffic and winding roads posing desirable foes for my motorcycle addiction. However, my time in LA reinforced a philosophical concept that I had forgotten: I am small and insignificant. While I am confident in my abilities, so are many others. It is a highly competitive world out there, and to "succeed" I must continue to work diligently and valiantly. I find this exciting and reassuring that my new-found direction is apt for me. I will be working as hard as I can to raise money so that come July, I can relocate out of state to pursue my passions.

With my partner, Luke, buying a house in Champaign, and my other partner, Brett, seeking to relocate to Champaign, this potentially poses a problem for our company. I am confident that we will be able to work something out. My current involvement in the company does not require my physical presence at this time. It is time that I take a big step towards my future. I have a vision. I have a goal. I have an ambitious future. I will see it fulfilled.

This means that my days in Champaign, IL are greatly numbered. I adore Champaign and have many fond memories of it, but my future lies elsewhere. Over the course of my vacation, I learned what kind of city-person I am. I adore LA for the weather and its film scene, but I am more of a New York City person. I love the industrial/business scene and can easily see myself living there some day. At the same time, film is my dream. I see Austin as a good compromise.

We shall see what the future holds.
