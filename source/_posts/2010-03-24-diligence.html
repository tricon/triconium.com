<p>My favorite definition of diligence that I keep as a digital sticky:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DILIGENCE is a learnable skill which combines: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">creative persistence</span>, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">smart-working</span> effort <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rightly planned</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rightly performed</span> in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">timely</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">efficient</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effective</span> manner to attain a result that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pure</span> and of the highest quality of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">excellence</span>.</p>
