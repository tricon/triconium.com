<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>The first describes a "system and method for performing an action on a structure in computer," the second a "real-time signal processing system for serially transmitted data." According to the ITC, HTC has infringed claims 1, 8, 15 and 19 of the '647 patent and 1, 2, 24 and 29 of the '263 patent.</p></blockquote>

<p>While Apple, and any company for that matter, has the right to defend their property and should, this situation serves as a grim reminder as to just how out of control the patent system is.</p>
