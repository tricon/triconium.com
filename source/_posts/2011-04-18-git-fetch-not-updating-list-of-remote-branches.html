title: Git Fetch Not Updating List of Remote Branches

<p>If this is the case, the issue is that your remote is setup as such:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
      url = url
      fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master</pre></div>
</div>


<p>and instead should be:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
      url = url
      fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</pre></div>
</div>


<p>in order to fetch all remote branches, not just master.</p>
