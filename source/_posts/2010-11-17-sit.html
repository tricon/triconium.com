<p>This morning my thoughts were abuzz. I obsessed. I thought of productivity, efficiency. Were my methods efficient? Maintainable? Could they scale?</p>

<p>It went further.</p>

<p>How much of the information that I have received in my life do I recall? Do I remember much of my schooling? How do I retain more information? What if I can&rsquo;t recall something in a time of need? What if I&rsquo;m wasting time reading things, taking them in, because I can&rsquo;t recall them? Is recalling them the point?</p>

<p>On and on.</p>

<p>Enough!</p>

<p>I decided to sit.</p>

<p>Yet even before I set my timer, I thought of sitting and of writing about sitting. What would I say? How would I form my words? I attempted to precompile my thoughts, writings, and speech as I ususally do.</p>

<p>Stop. Set the timer and sit.</p>

<p>I sat.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t done so in months. Yet while I didn&rsquo;t experience some transcedent experience as one rarely if ever does, I was able to calm myself. I listened to the whir of a hard drive. I listened to the horn of a passing train, and soonafter, the echo of the rails as the train sped towards its destination. And after?</p>

<p>Well, I still don&rsquo;t know if my methods are efficient. I still don&rsquo;t know if they will scale. I have no clue as to whether there are gaping holes in my structure for productivity; but I feel more at rest. It&rsquo;s not peace, it&rsquo;s not clarity, it&rsquo;s not even a feeling of refreshment. I simply feel more calm, more neutral and regular.</p>

<p>That is exactly where I need to be to focus and get things done.</p>

<p>Sit.</p>
