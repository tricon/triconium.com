<p>For some time I have been intending to write every day. It is a goal I have failed at over and over again. Lately I&rsquo;ve been desiring more structure, as I often to periodically,  occurring every few months like a sine wave without fail.</p>

<p>I have been here before. I have tried before. I have failed before. As with a previous occurrence, I have no fuzzy emotions about this. No &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this!&rdquo; bursting through my veins. Just cold, semi-objective, &ldquo;This needs to be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will slip again. I will fail to write for a day or two. This time I have a dear friend that is going to keep me accountable to writing every day. This time I have a new friend that is going to coax me when it comes to writing technology related posts. This time things will be different.</p>
