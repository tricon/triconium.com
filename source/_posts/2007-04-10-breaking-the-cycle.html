Today was a sad day for me. I called a very good friend of mine only to find out that he just moved to Kansas yesterday. I was going to call him on Friday to hang out with him, but I ended up going to see "Grindhouse" instead. I had no idea he was planning to move to Kansas and it sounds like the decision was pretty sudden.

The good news is that I am hoping to go visit him in the summer. We talked about how we really want to take a trip together to California to hang out as we are both quite fond of the state. We also seem to be going through a very similar situation in life -- what are we passionate about? Nevertheless, I am going to miss him immensely, but we both have agreed to stay in touch and to seriously make plans for the trip.

Tonight Rob and I finished season two of "Scrubs" and are almost half way through the third season. More memories to add, both of "Scrubs" itself and of watching them with Rob. There are so many beautiful, touching, and hilarious moments in "Scrubs," and Rob and I have become so attached to the characters that we often quote, discuss, and relate to them. Scrubs and it's cast and crew deserve Emmy after Emmy.

I called my brother today to express my sadness in Mark moving, but I could not reach him. What is interesting is how in an episode of "Scrubs" that I watched tonight, Dan, J.D.'s older brother, stood up for J.D. even after J.D. said some very damaging things to him. It was a reminder to put our differences aside with our siblings, and to love them no matter what. I relate to this because it has become hard to talk to my brother due to our strong differences in spiritual beliefs. I just need to let go and love.

Sometimes I wonder if I have seen the future, better yet, a glimpse of it. I know Rob has, but perhaps I lack the faith to truly believe that something I have seen in my mind is that of the future. I often write it off as being conjured up by my own imagination, and considering my over-active imagination, it very well could be. I guess I will know it when I see it, though it will be after-the-fact. Hindsight is 20/20.
