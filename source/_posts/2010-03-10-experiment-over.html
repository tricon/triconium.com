<p>Well that was a fun little experiment. I want to use this space as a place for my thoughts and interests. However, simply snipping articles and reposting them really serves no purpose. That's over. From now on, if I reference an article, it will be to post my thoughts -- not merely to regurgitate news.</p>
<p>I still may repost interesting video clips, comics, and images, but those are suitable to the Posterous format.</p>
