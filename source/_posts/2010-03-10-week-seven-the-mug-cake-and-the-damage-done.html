<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Once I had a friend practically berate me when I mentioned that I would like to lose 20 lbs. "Why are you so concerned about conforming to society's ideals," she asked. "This is how the beauty industry wants you to think! You should accept and love yourself the way you are." She kept harping on about it until I wished I wouldn't have said anything at all. Who would have thought that making a hopeful statement and wanting to change your life for the better could elicit such a negative response? It's bullshit, by the way: if everyone accepted themselves the way they were, we wouldn't have Olympic atheletes or great writers or musicians. We need to have the desire to push ourselves to accomplish something more extraordinary.</blockquote>
