It's been six years since the last Star Trek film titled, "Nemesis". While I enjoyed Nemesis, the Star Trek films have never been so epic until now. Hinted at in "First Contact" when Picard mentions the importance of humanity discovering alien life for the first time, the scale and magnitude of Star Trek seems to finally be apprehended in the upcoming flick by J. J. Abrams.

This trailer is truly stirring. The opening sequence teases you by making you think it's something it's not, but when you hear, "My name's James Tiberius Kirk", you can't help but get that chill that says, "It's here." The trailer then begins to set the atmosphere of the film: Kirk, a lost man, looking to find his place in the world. Spock, a man of two worlds. I really hope that this film delivers on character development as Kirk and Spock are two of the most well known science fiction characters of all time.

Action ensues, and you can't help but become excited at Abram's cinematic approach to the piece. Swooping cameras, dolly-twists, and beautiful visuals set this film up to be a true work of art. While I've grown up a Star Wars fan and not a trekkie, I have always enjoyed and appreciated Star Trek -- especially Star Trek's diplomatic emphasis as opposed to Star War's "cool factor." This film may convert me to a trekkie.

Move over Star Wars prequels. This is how you resurrect a legacy.
