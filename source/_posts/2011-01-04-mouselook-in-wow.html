<p>If you play WoW and miss toggled mouselook functionality, the following macro will fix you right up:</p>
<p><code>/run if IsMouselooking() then MouselookStop() else MouselookStart() end</code></p>
<p>Bind it to a key for easy access. To disengage, hit the key a second time or right click.</p>
<p>This makes it much easier to track targets and play on a trackpad. Also, if you're using a trackpad or single button pointer device on a Mac, Holding CMD while clicking will act as a right click.</p>
