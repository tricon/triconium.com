title: " VIM: The Greatest Editor"

Last year I bought the first MacHeist which contained a copy of TextMate. TextMate is by far one of the best editors that I've ever used, and as an OS X only app, has been the envy of other platform users. 

But it still can't touch VIM. VIM is my editor of choice. While TextMate boasts a great UI and killer bundles and customization, VIM has had this for 15 years. Just take a look around [vim.org](<a href="http://www.vim.org">http://www.vim.org</a> "VIM") -- there's a script for nearly everything. This very post was written and submitted with a VIM plugin.

My number one reason for switching back to VIM: keyboard orientation. If you write a lot of code like myself, you don't want to keep reaching for the mouse or even the arrow keys. VIM's setup and design keeps your fingers happy right at home. It's also available for many platforms. I invite you to check it out at [vim.org](<a href="http://www.vim.org">http://www.vim.org</a> "VIM").
