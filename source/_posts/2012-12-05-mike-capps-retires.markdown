Mike Capps of Epic Games is retiring:

> It’s hard to believe I’m writing these words, but here goes! After 10 crazy and wonderful years, I’m handing off my current presidential duties at Epic, and transitioning into an advisory role as well as remaining on the Epic board of directors.

You will be greatly missed, Mike Capps. Godspeed.
