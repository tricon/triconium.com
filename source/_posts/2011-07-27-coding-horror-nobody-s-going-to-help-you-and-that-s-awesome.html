      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">For example, I don't care if anyone reads what I write here. I'm writing to satisfy myself first and foremost. If others read it and benefit from it, fantastic -- that's a welcome side effect. If I worry about <i>who</i> is reading, <i>why</i> they're reading, or if <i>anyone</i> is even reading at all, I'd be too paralyzed to write! That'd be the least productive outcome of all.</blockquote>

    <p>The "self-help" books I love are the ones that aren't trying to help or guide you directly but are simply giving insights. Three great examples are: "The War of Art" by Steven Pressfield, "Poke the Box" by Seth Godin, and "Self-Reliance" by Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p></div>
