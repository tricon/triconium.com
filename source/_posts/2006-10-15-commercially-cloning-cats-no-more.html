<p>The biotech company, Genetic Savings and Loan, will be refunding it's customers $50,000 fees for having their cats cloned as they close their doors this year. After six years of research, the technology has not advanced enought to make cloning pets comercially viable.</p>
<p>For some this raises huge ethical debates. As cloning advances, it is only a matter of time before a human is cloned. Is cloning the wave of the future? Or is it as unethical as playing God?
