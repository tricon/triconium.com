[[posterous-content:nJHlBJuuzErDDoqwjwcp]]Forget the black and white zunes, I want mine poop-colored. I love earthy tones, but this is rediculous. People with brown zunes are merely going to be the new target for playground and corporate bullies. With nearly every Microsoft product being a rehash of another already existing product, I guess this is how Microsoft felt it could achieve its solidarity in the portable media player marketplace. If at any point Apple felt threatened by the Zune, their fears have since been laid to rest.
