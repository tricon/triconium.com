Heather Salm and Micah Boyce were married yesterday. I must say, it was one of the coolest wedding I have ever been to. Not only was it imbued with joy and happiness, but it featured such incredible music. Never have I seen so many talented musicians perform in a single wedding. I truly wish the best for Heather and Micah.

On a more humorous note, Luke gave the funniest speech that I've ever heard at a wedding. You really have to hear it for yourself to fully appreciate it. That man can write... and I'm jealous! I really need to write more. I truly am my own worst enemy.

I got to hang out with my hopefully-future-roommate, Matt, at the wedding. That man is 110% awesome and then some. I've been scoping for apartments as I think it will be much easier if my roommates and I all move out at the same time, otherwise there's issues with the deposit that I'd rather not deal with. I'm hoping we can check some apartments out very soon -- maybe this week.

I have a meeting with Josh tomorrow at 6:15 AM! I'm using him as my alarm clock so that I can get my body back on a sleep schedule. We're going to go over a web site concept that he has been working on, and I'm going to apprentice him in the art of web design and development. He definitely has the mind for it, and I really hope he sticks with it.

I love Sam Yergler -- I really do. Lately he has really been an inspiration and encouragement to me, let alone a source of some of the funniest stories I have ever heard. He is so easy to talk to and so understanding as well. I have never felt judged by him. I think we all could learn a lesson in selflessness and encouragement from him, and I hope that we remain friends for the rest of our lives.

This week is a week of finishing up projects. With the company restructure hopefully getting full approval this week, I'm hoping to be in a position to contract and hire more freelancers so that I can begin to focus on animation -- more specifically writing our first animation. I have a concept that I am very excited about, and I can't wait to reveal it in due time.

Alas, I must go and do my daily workout for The PCP. I've made a lot of progress, and I'm becoming more and more excited as I see the results. By all means, please feel free to offer words of encouragement! I sure could use them as it's only going to get harder.
