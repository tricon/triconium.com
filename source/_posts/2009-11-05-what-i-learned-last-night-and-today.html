Last night I learned not to react to a girl's Shit Test (ST). If she <br />is intentionally being a bitch, of course the natural reaction is to <br />stand up for oneself. However, this means that she has either gotten <br />the reaction she wanted or weeded you out if she's playing games. <br />Don't react adversely! Instead, either make light of her ST (ideal), <br />or ignore it completely and change the subject. <p /> Today I learned to plan, plan, plan and research, research, research! <br />I ended up spending a couple hours on namespacing some ActiveRecord <br />models only to learn that in the long run that this is very messy, and <br />AR doesn't play well with it yet.
