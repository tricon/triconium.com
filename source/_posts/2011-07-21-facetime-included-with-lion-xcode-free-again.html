title: FaceTime Included With Lion, Xcode Free Again

<p>When FaceTime debuted months ago, it came with a price: $1. One dollar is nothing for such a useful application, but many wondered why Apple was charging for it.</p>

<p>Around this time, Xcode 4 was released. It too came with a cost: $5 if you did not have a paid Apple developer account, free if you did. Since Xcode had always been free regardless, many wondered what exactly Apple was up to with some speculating that they were attempting to push developers towards paid accounts.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://triconium.com/on-the-cost-of-facetime-and-xcode-4">On the Cost of FaceTime and Xcode 4</a>, I argued that it is in Apple&rsquo;s best interest that Xcode remain free:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>While $5 for Xcode is nothing compare to what Microsoft charges for Visual Studio, I feel that it is in Apple&rsquo;s best interest that these applications be free. At the price of free, Apple is bolstered as an enabler of their own platforms. At the price of free, their paid developer programs are further promoted through zero-risk use of their tools.</p></blockquote>

<p>FaceTime is now included with Lion for free. Xcode 4.1 is now free and available on the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>Perhaps Apple saw these costs as early-access fees. Maybe they were just testing the waters, seeing how much they could get away with. Regardless, I am pleased that Apple has reversed this decision by including FaceTime for free to all users of Lion and promoting its excellent platforms, APIs, and tools through making Xcode free once again.</p>
