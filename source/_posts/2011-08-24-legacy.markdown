[Steve Jobs has stepped down as CEO of Apple Inc.](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/08/24Letter-from-Steve-Jobs.html)

It had been a dream of mine for some time to go to WWDC, to experience a keynote given by him.

First and foremost, I hope and pray that he is okay. One can not help but speculate as to the reasons for his departure.

At the same time, I am curiously looking forward to Cook's reign at Apple, to see how he pulls the teams together and leads the company into the future. There is a lot of talent at Apple.

Finally, I am inspired. Steve Jobs is an incredible leader, innovator, and inspiration to his team, his co-workers, his fans, and many aspiring artists, technologists, and entrepreneurs around the world. I find myself challenged not to be him, but to take on the best of him — his standards, his vigor, his passion — so that I might be the same in my life, my work, my art.

Thank you for your legacy, Steve.
