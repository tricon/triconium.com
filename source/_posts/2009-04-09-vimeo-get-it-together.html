<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/forums/topic:12128">A post on the Vimeo forums a couple weeks ago has begun to cause quite a stir</a>.

Vimeo has changed their Terms of Service to state:

"VIMEO shall be entitled to unrestricted use of any Submission for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the submitter."

In contrast, Blip.tv's TOS states:

"Blip.tv respects the fact that your content is yours, and will not sell advertising on your content or sell your content without your permission."

There's a rather stark difference between these two TOSs. Vimeo backs up their TOS by stating, "For legal reasons and technical realities, we need to keep the language broad in our Terms &amp; Conditions; however, that being said, we do not generally commericialize any members' videos, and if you are making your posts private, it is very unlikely we ever would."

I understand that when running a service such as Vimeo, things can get hairy on the legal side. Having a more liberal TOS in favor of Vimeo eases that pain for them. However, if Vimeo wishes to grow its user base and avoid a potential boycott, it needs to endure the pains of writing a more clearly defined TOS in favor of the user.

What <em>you</em> create should belong to you regardless of where you choose to host it. Vimeo has rights, but only as the distributor, not as the owner. Decide for yourself, but I for one will not be hosting any material on Vimeo until their TOS is reflective of Blip.tv's attitude towards user content.
