<p>Why is it than when I think of or attempt to do something that is important to me, I always find a way to not do it, to avoid it? This is a rhetorical question as I know the answer: doing these things would make me happy. If you fail to understand why our bodies do not want us to be happy, you must read Steven Pressfield&rsquo;s, &ldquo;The War of Art&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As I write this, my fingers drudge on. I wish they would dance, but alas, the energy, the music is not there for them to do so. They behave like an orchestra without a conductor, voicing their potentially melodic opinions without beat, without order, without soul.</p>

<p>Regardless, I command them to drudge on. March! Stop! Push! Pull! March!</p>

<p>I must tame these tiny dancers that they might tame me. They are the workers and I am their master. I care for them. I want what&rsquo;s best for them, but I recognize that what is best for them is what is best for me. We can work together.</p>

<p>Aha! I&rsquo;m on to you, stomach. I feel you craving breakfast. Stop. Stop! You <em>will</em> stop. I know it&rsquo;s not your fault, it&rsquo;s that damn subconscious — no — it&rsquo;s that damn Resistance feeding you lies. &ldquo;But I must eat! Please! Feed me lest I starve!&rdquo; Ha! I will not starve and thus you shan&rsquo;t either. Now be quiet! I am sharpening my blade to defeat the beast that is Resistance today. I&rsquo;ll have to face him yet again tomorrow, but with practice comes experience; so please, hush now as I need to think.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling better already. I&rsquo;m feeling more revitalized now. Yes, I&rsquo;m on to you too, brain. I know you want a nap, but all you will get is coffee, work, and thoughts until tonight, so get ready to process some information. What&rsquo;s that? I <em>know</em> you&rsquo;ve been up for seven hours already. Does it look like I care? Stop your whining and perk up.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s better. Anyone else? Anyone else feel like griping? That&rsquo;s what I thought.</p>

<p>Okay, now. What do I need to do today? Well, I really want to blog every day, so I need to do that. I should probably do some creative writing as well. I keep putting my stories off with the excuse that I just need to take care of some things first, but I know that is a lie. I can do today what I wish to put off &lsquo;til tomorrow.</p>

<p>Code, yes, more code must be spewed into the world. Noted. Friends? Yes, I should see friends today. Tell you what. How about I get four hours of work in, blog, creatively write for an hour, and then I can see friends. Does that work for you? What&rsquo;s that? You want to just veg for now? Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. You thought I actually cared what you thought. I was just being polite. This is what we&rsquo;ll be doing today; and I just discovered what I am going to write about.</p>
