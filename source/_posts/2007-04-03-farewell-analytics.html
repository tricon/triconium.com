I can be quite analytical. I think this stems from my perfectionist, logical side. No more. This blog was initially going to be geared towards technology, art, and culture. I have since come to accept the fact that you can get such information and opinions form hundreds of other blogs on the Internet. What you can only find here, however, is my heart.

I'm an extremely emotional guy. Not in the "I cry a lot" sense, but I am connected at the soul to my feelings. Hereforth, you will find my feelings, not mere analytical opinions. Some people think through life -- I feel.

My feelings may be in the form of art: lyrics, writings, poetry, and others; and they may be mere ramblings. Consider this a opportunity to look into the journal of my life.
