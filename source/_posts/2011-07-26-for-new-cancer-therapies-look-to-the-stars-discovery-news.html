<p>When you <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/how-to-choose-a-telescope-110127.html">look up at the night sky</a> -- whether with the naked eye or with your spiffy Celestron telescope -- how often do you stop to consider which chemical elements might be present in their gassy glow? Astronomers use several different methods to study how different chemicals emit and absorb radiation inside stars (and even black holes), but they get widely varying results.</p>

<p>Now astronomers think they might have a new technique for doing so, with an added bonus: it could also lead to a potential new cancer radiation treatment capable of precisely targeting tumors without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue. Sultana Nahar of Ohio State University <a href="http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/astrotherapy.htm" target="_self">described the research</a> at the International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy in June.</p>
