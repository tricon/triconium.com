Recent reports claim that Verizon has been turning away new DSL customers due to over-capacity. Instead of increasing capacity to meet demand, Verizon has instead insisted on ending linesharing requirements or removing net neutrality to help them better meet demand. Aww, poor Verizon. It's not bad enough that they lock out their phones. It's not bad enough that they're engineering their new fiber networks with the expectation that their bandwidth won't fully be utilized. It's not bad enough that they cancel users accounts if they saturate too much bandwidth.

Consider it a good thing that customers are getting turned away. They don't have to put up with Verizon: The Evil Empire.
