<p>A number of reports have shown that teens prefer texting and IM to email. Do teens not appreciate longevity? An email can be easily stored and referenced. It is much harder to do so with a text message or IM.</p>
<p>Does this beg the need for a service that does so? Or is it good, in-the-moment, that text messages and IMs are so temporary?</p>
