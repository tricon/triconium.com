<p><a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-introduces-new-plans-and.html">Netflix&rsquo;s blog and Twitter account are being hammered by customers upset over the 60% price increase Netflix will be levying on many customers starting September 1st</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>Plan 1: Unlimited Streaming (no DVDs) for $7.99 a month
Plan 2: Unlimited DVDs, 1 out at-a-time (no streaming), for $7.99 a month.</p>

<p>The price for getting both of these plans will be $15.98 a month ($7.99 + $7.99).</p></blockquote>

<p>While many are understandably upset over this significant increase, the story does not end with greed.</p>

<p>Streaming is a considerably more cost effective content delivery system than mailing DVDs. <a href="http://www.techspot.com/news/42036-mail-service-costs-netflix-20-times-more-than-streaming.html">According to Emil Protalinski at TechSpot</a>, Netflix pays up to $1 when a customer chooses to utilize their DVD service. In contrast,
<a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/the_business_of_online_vi/2011/03/netflixs-streaming-costs-drop-50-from-2009-expected-to-spend-50m-in-2011.html">Dan Rayburn estimates that it costs Netflix just $0.025 to stream content to a customer</a>. For Netflix, the cost savings are colossal. Compounding the issue, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/07/08/technology/netflix_starz_contract/index.htm?hpt=hp_t2">Julianne Pepitone reports that content providers are looking to charge Netflix more in upcoming negotiations</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>When streaming video was new, Netflix was able to secure contracts with the likes of Warner Bros. Studios and MTV to license big TV and film catalogues for about $5 million to $10 million per year. This time around, Pachter says, those costs could increase more than tenfold.</p></blockquote>

<p>A bigger picture begins to emerge: If content providers charge Netflix more, that cost is passed on to the customer. Yet if customers no longer deem Netflix a worthy service, Netflix and the content providers' revenue is impeded â€” we all lose.</p>

<p>Though they may be justified, no customer appreciates price hikes. Such situations must be mitigated through top-notch customer service, often by grandfathering current or loyal customers into special pricing plans. Considering the noise being generated by the Twittersphere, Netflix must respond. This is their chance to address customers' concerns, ensuring them that these cost savings to Netflix will be used to acquire additional, quality content for and future technological expansion of their streaming service.</p>
