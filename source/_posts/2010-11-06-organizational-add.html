<p>Over the years I have tried many different forms of digital organization. The search-don't-sort method, where you throw things in generic folders such as Documents then search for them, proved too chaotic. It also discouraged browsing, which can remind one of forgotten documents as well as trigger new thoughts and concept</p>
<p>Meticulously sorting documents into folders is often too time consuming. While it is "browsing friendly", it lacks flexibility. Does an article on historical fiction go under fiction, history, or writing?</p>
<p>Tagging can supplement both searching and sorting methods, but it can also be a burden and a headache. Do you tag both singular nouns and plural? What about synonyms? How much or little do you tag? These questions make tagging undesirable.</p>
<p>So if none of these methods are the answer, what is?</p>
<p><strong>Enter DEVONthink</strong></p>
<p>DEVONthink allows you to search, sort, and tag as much as desired, but more importantly, it creates relationships between your documents. It analyzes keywords, and over time, offers increasingly intelligent suggestions for related documents, as well as where to place the document in your organizational hierarchy.  While it can't analyze the contents of every file, it does accept any file into its database. This effectively turns DEVONthink into a super-Finder; and DEVONthink databases are Spotlight friendly.</p>

<p><strong>An Example Workflow</strong></p>

</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Use databases to separate your files. Separate databases are more portable than large, encompassing databases.</em></span></p>

</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Use folders to separate contexts and smart folders to aggregate documents.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></em></p>

</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Use tags to describe attributes that the analytics can not infer. An example would be describing departments or document statuses.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></em></p>
<p>[[posterous-content:cAzFBhazryCGrkltykau]]
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>See Also and Classify propose related documents and organizational locations for the selected document.</em></span></p>
<hr />
<p>Of course one can mix and match these methods to their liking, but having the power of analytics greatly saves on the time required to organize effectively.</p>

<p>What methods have you found work well for you? What is your ideal method for&nbsp;digital organization?</p>
