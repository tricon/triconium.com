I'm in the process of restructuring many things: my company, my blog, my life.

<strong>My Company</strong>

While it hasn't been officially approved, my company and I are looking to restructure so that the company is more expandable and profitable. It's a delicate task, but I feel that it is important. With our current direction, we're going to be tied down to living from paycheck to paycheck with no room to expand. Our new direction allows us to function like a real company with assets and eventually employees.

<strong>My Blog</strong>

I love to write, I really do; but what keeps me from blogging more is a lack of discipline. For some time I have been indecisive as to what direction to take this blog in. I have decided that "Essence" will be my forum for my thoughts and musings. It's win-win -- it's therapeutic, and if someone can take something away from it, then so much the better.

<strong>My Life</strong>

For several years I have battled having a lack of energy. I am on the road to recovery. The first major wave of energy came when I went Pescetarian the first week of the year. After about three weeks, my energy levels were considerably higher. The second wave came shortly after I started <a href="http://peakconditionproject.blogspot.com">The Peak Condition Project</a> with Chen, Patrick, Corry, and Sean. I've decided that it's time to get in the best shape of my life. The Peak Condition Project is my answer.

Last year I asked a lot of hard questions, mainly those regarding life and spirituality. While I feel that I have more direction now than I did then, I'm still asking those hard questions while keeping an open mind. I'm listening to a Buddhist podcast and loving it, while at the same time retaining an open heart towards the words of men like Rob Bell. My goal is not to "craft my own religion," but to find truth. 

For some time I made the excuse that I did not have time for a relationship. I've realized that my life is only going to get busier, and that if it's important to me to have a relationship, I must sacrifice the time. It's worth it; it's important. I have some prospects, and I'm keeping my options open.

My roommates will be moving out in August. I adore them, but it's time for them to have their own place separate of me. I'm looking to move in with my good friend's Matt and Nathan. I adore these guys, and we would have a lot of fun living together. We may take over the lease where I am right now, and we may find a new place. It's up in the air.

I'm going through big changes in my life, but I'm excited. I've had a good life, and it's getting better all the time. Here's to a very bright future.
