What is an Eflection?

Eflections are a combination of three components comprising one essence: reflection, inflection, and inspiration. They are intended to stir the mind into critical thinking, the heart into critical feeling, and the soul into critical being.

In the following articles you will find opinion, fact, and emotion. The journey into the evolution of the soul needs not to be a path walked alone, nor filled with hatred. As thus, I invite you to join me in finding truth. May your comments not mame, but inspire us to sift through the lies and find a source so pure, so true, so beautiful.

Welcome to the journey.
