In mid 2007, through a Ruby on Rails podcast, I discovered an up-and-coming service called, "Twitter". Twitter was a service that made sense to me. Fascinated, I saw its potential, and nearly a month later I had the beginnings of a personal network of acquaintances and future friends. 

Nearly two years later, Twitter is still a part of my daily routine.

For my reflection, I would like to mention some of the Tweeple that I have grown closer to because of Twitter. These select individuals have transcended from Internet acquaintances to real life friends.

<a href="http://www.grahamenglish.net/">Graham English</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/grahamenglish/">@grahamenglish</a>)<br />
Graham was one of my early mutual follows. A successful musician, blogger, and a fellow coffee aficionado, Graham has become very dear to me. In the early days of Twitter, we connected through our love of keyboards, music, and Macs. Nearly two years later, we have grown to share views on politics, science, religion, film, and life in general. I greatly admire Graham for his fervor for music, making a living out of what he loves, and as a freelancer. Graham is the kind of friend that always has your back. I most certainly will always have his. While I have not had the pleasure of meeting Graham in person, I aim to do so within the next year, buying each other that beer we have been promising.

<a href="http://gwenbell.com">Gwen Bell</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/gwenbell">@gwenbell</a>)<br />
I discovered Gwen Bell's blog through Graham English. As one of the most passionate individuals I have known, Gwen's expertise is broad, ranging from social media to technology, spirituality, humanism, and beyond. Her enthusiasm not only brightens my Twitter stream, it inspires me personally. A creative woman, I will never forget a hilarious prank her and I pulled on our mutual friend, Patrick Reynolds. Hearing her unforgettable laugh brings a smile, reminding me of what a caring, light-hearted woman she is.

<a href="http://hereliespatrick.com">Patrick Reynolds</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/patrickcantype">@patrickcantype</a>)<br />
Through Gwen's blog and the podcast she co-produces, "Zen Is Stupid", I discovered a man on a mission. That man was Patrick Reynolds. His mission: The Peak Condition Project. His goal: to achieve the body of Bruce Lee through daily exercise and conscious, life-long change in body and mind. He succeeded and has now developed a business inspiring others to make such changes in their lives as well. Also a music connoisseur and graphic designer, Patrick is wise and understanding, having helped me through many parts of my life.  A visionary, Patrick has become dear friend, and a model of hard work and dedication.

<a href="http://www.rambls.com/">Jeff Ledoux</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/rambls">@rambls</a>)<br />
My friendship with Jeff is a perfect example of how truly small the world is. Over a year ago I emailed the web service Me.dium suggesting they release a plugin for Safari. A response came from a man named Jeff Ledoux. As further emails were exchanged, Jeff and I began to connect and develop a friendship; one that branched through IM, Twitter, and other web sites and services. Jeff and I have a deep friendship that has allowed us to open up about very personal parts of our lives -- a friendship that is only growing stronger.

<a href="http://www.ocell.net/">Chris Owens</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/ocell">@ocell</a>)<br />
Chris Owens is an upcoming industrial designer. His attention to detail and taste for quality art and product design is inspiring, and his penchant for 3D imagery gives us a common ground. My friendship with Chris solidified when we discovered that we were both on a journey. Taking the conversation to a more personal level, Chris and I were able to relate further and encourage each other. Chris has become a very good friend, and I am looking forward to watching our friendship evolve even further.

<a href="http://www.jefftippett.com">Jeff Tippett</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/jefftippett">@jefftippett</a>)<br />
Jeff Tippett is many things rolled into one. He is a people-person, a natural leader, outgoing, and an incredible friend. Jeff is one of my early mutual follows as well, and is one of the few people I have met over the Internet that I have actually talked to on the phone. Jeff has always been there for me, whether he is offering words of wisdom, cracking a joke, or making a friendly jab. He inspires me through his words, character, and love for his children. I adore Jeff and know that our friendship is just beginning.

<a href="http://leahwallace.wordpress.com/">Leah Wallace</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/matthewsChick">@MatthewsChick</a>)<br />
Leah is one of the most energizing women I have ever met. Full of life, love, and laughs, Leah is the kind of friend you always greet with a hug. Her warm demeanor and love for her friends and family is intoxicating, setting an example of how truly beautiful the selfless love of others is. Though my friendship with Leah has just begun, her reception of our new-found friendship has made me feel as if we have been friends for years. Leah is truly a blessing, and I am thankful for her friendship.

Jerry Chen (<a href="http://twitter.com/jcsalterego">@jcsalterego</a>)<br />
Some time ago, I received a new follower notification. It was a man named Jerry Chen. Following him back, I learned that he used to live here in Champaign, IL, and now lives where I intend to move: Austin, TX. Jerry cracks me up as he is highly intelligent and witty. We always have something to chat about as he is also a programmer, though he worships the snake (Python) as I envy the gem (Ruby). Jerry introduced me to an IRC channel for Champaign-Urbana computer scientists, and it was through this chat channel that I was able to get to know Jerry better, meet like minds, and make new friends.

<a href="http://sweetcinnamonwontons.com/">Don Yuhas</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/DonAtPoundCS">@DonAtPoundCS</a>)<br />
Don Yuhas is a badass. I was introduced to Don through Jerry as Don hangs out in the aforementioned chat channel. We shortly began following each other on Twitter, finally meeting at the first C-U Tweetup on April first. Don is a computer scientist and future fellow motorcyclist. He is an incredibly supportive, welcoming individual and is the kind of person that you are always eager to chat or hang out with. I look forward to getting to know Don better over the coming years.

<a href="http://www.twoslashes.com/">Nick Tabick</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/nicktabick">@nicktabick</a>)<br />
I first met Nick Tabick in the aforementioned chat channel and later in person at the local Tweetup. Thoughtful, intelligent, and open-minded, Nick is a person whose advice I greatly trust. Though programming, Linux, and classic PC gaming give us plenty of ground to relate on, it is his cool, collected, welcoming presence that makes Nick one of the most unforgettable people I have met. He is an incredibly observant individual, and while I have not known Nick very long, is quickly becoming a good friend.

<br />
Twitter has opened social doors over the Internet in a whole new way. Unlike services like Facebook that connect already connected individuals, Twitter is about building a network -- your network. Through friends, mentions, and search, one can begin to build a personalized community organized around like minds and common ground, or differences. You decide. Your Twittersphere allows you to receive influence from those you follow while allowing you to exert influence upon those that follow you. It is a powerful system.

I, for one, am thankful. I am thankful for the opportunity Twitter has given me to get connected to others, to become acquainted, to become friends. Graham, Gwen, Patrick, Jeff, Chris, Jeff, Leah, Jerry, Don, and Nick -- thank you. Thank you for your follows, and most importantly, thank you for your friendship.

Thanks to all of you for connecting with me, whether on this blog, Twitter, IRC, or otherwise.

This is just the beginning.
