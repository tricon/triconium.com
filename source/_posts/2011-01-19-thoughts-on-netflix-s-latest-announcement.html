<p>It is to be determined as to what capacity this change will take place:</p>

<p>1) If all streaming devices currently only show results for streamable titles, this change will be negligible. Users utilizing a streaming device are using it for the given purpose.</p>

<p>2) If this change prevents users from using apps that can search the entire Netflix catalog, allowing the user to add non-streamable titles to their queue, this is a poor, too-soon decision.</p>

<p>3) If searching for a title results in one that is not streamable, prompting the user to add it to their DVD queue from their web site instead, this is bad user experience.</p>

<p>Regardless, Netflix still has the following critical issues to overcome:</p>

<p>1) Netflix's selection of streaming titles is poor. Netflix is fighting a difficult battle in acquiring streaming licenses, one that isn't likely to be adequately resolved any time soon.</p>

<p>2) Where are the extras? Discs afford the luxury of extras: special features, behind the scenes, and more.</p>

<p>3) The average Internet connection speed and capacity is pathetic in the US compared to other parts of the world. What good are streaming titles if they need to re-buffer or must frequently drop in quality in order to maintain continuity?</p>

<p>4) Streaming media doesn't even come close to the quality of a Blu-ray disc, and Netflix's 720p "HD" titles suffer additional compression. We are a long way from being able to stream 1080p, Dolby Digital 5.1 movies and films at Blu-ray quality¹.</p>

<p>In order incentivize more customers to adopt streaming media, Netflix must resolve these issues.</p>

<p>¹ Note that even the Blu-ray rips one can pirate off of the Internet are of lower quality than a typical Blu-ray release.</p>
