It is best to live your life for no one else; focus on yourself.  Is this a selfish attitude?  It depends on how you look at it:

If you adopt the concept that no one other than yourself is important, that only your needs matter, than it is selfish.  This is not the correct attitude.  The correct attitude is one of apathy to acclaim from others.  The best thing you can do is to pursue your interests for your own sake.  The awe of man means nothing and will leave you hollow.  

Your best motivation is to find something within your work that excites you, that gives you meaning, that gives you joy.  Not all of these can be tapped at the same time, or from every project, but the key is to find something that fuels your creative drive.  Only then can you break the chains of "floating"...and free yourself as an artist.
