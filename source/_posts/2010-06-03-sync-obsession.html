<p>I've spent the last hour or so trying to determine an ideal solution for syncing RSS feeds between the iPad and Mac. Unfortunately, they're aren't a lot of good solutions. <p /> That's okay. Upon reflection, I've realized that I've become obsessed with syncing, having my data with me at all times. Yet is this really that important? <p /> I use MobileMe to remotely access files when needed. This has worked well, and I have been unable to connect to my home Mac on only a few occasions. These few hiccups have never been a show-stopper. Previously I took this obsession further, putting all of my company files on iDisk in case I needed them. This only took up valuable space and caused syncing headaches. Task management: same story. Now it's RSS. <p /> I worry too much over future-proofing my solutions "just in case." Yet any time something hasn't worked out, I've been fine. My new perspective is domain specific: utilize each device for what it does best. Do I really need to track my location in a book so that I can resume reading it on the computer? No. Do I really need to have all of my feeds and read states synced across my iMac, MacBook Air, and iPad? No. Sure, it's convenient, but the overhead isn't worth it. Where syncing is useful is with email, but email is a general purpose task in which we have standards such as IMAP to provide syncing solutions. <p /> To attempt to have the same experience on every platform voids the given platforms of their unique expressions. Taking advantage of a platform's unique abilities is something I have preached fervently, yet I now catch myself disobeying it. <p /> No more. <p /> I am now using the iPad as my primary source for reading books, feeds, and for its unique multitouch capabilities and applications. I believe that the iPad has opened up a new age in computing. We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg, and apps like iBooks and Pulse on the iPad completely replace their computer counterparts with a much better experience. If I'm not near my iPad to read feeds or books, tough. I'll find something else to do. Besides, do I really need to read a feed as soon as it's updated, from anywhere at anytime? <p /> I think not.</p>
