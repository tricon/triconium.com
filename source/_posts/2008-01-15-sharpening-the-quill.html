It's been a rather long time since my last post. A lot has happened -- most good, some bad. Life occurs in seasons, and in these past few seasons I have been able to reflect and grow.

A new beginning. From henceforth, this site will be informative and educational in order to give back to a community that has offered so much to me over the years. You may still find the occasional personal piece, but expect a much more defined direction.
