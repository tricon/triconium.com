<p>The Neat Company, I know you think you're being helpful by including this first button, but you're not. When I think, "I should see if there's an update," I don't also think, "I should check the same place in the event I wish to reinstall." It also doesn't make sense. If I need to reinstall, I'm going to go to your site to download the application. I'm not going to fire up my broken application to check its update option for a link to download the application for reinstallation (Just read this last sentence out loud to hear how ridiculous this process sounds).</p>
<p>Also, ever heard of Sparkle? <a href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Here's a link in case you haven't</a>. I shouldn't have to go to your website, download a DMG, open it, and replace my current version with the latest one in order to update. Sparkle is your friend. Please use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>David Aaron Fendley</p>
