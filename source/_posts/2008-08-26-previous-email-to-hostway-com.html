The proceeding email is what I sent to <a href="mailto:support@hostway.com">support@hostway.com</a> regarding a very simple request:


<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">It's a damn shame that you can't provide such basic services that are easily available through other hosts, like Crucial Paradigm (crucialp.com if you want to see why they rock). I can easily dump and manage databases with them.

But hey, if you want to aspire to mediocrity, go right ahead. I can't stop you.

What I can do is cut my losses. Unfortunately, the person formerly in charge of the domain paid for the year in full. We'll have to cut our losses as we move to other providers -- providers that are competent.

Oh, and you made my company's Blacklist. We'll be talking all of our future clients out of utilizing your services unless you can "magically" address this issue appropriately.
