<p>Me: I have a really funny story for you... <br /> So last night a bunch of us are out for my roommates' 30th birthday.... <p />  Well about 7 of us are sitting around this table at this bar on <br />campus, and this guy walks by that looks like a total douchebag.<p />  So I tell everyone at the table, "Watch. I'm going to go call this <br />guy a douchebag.." "They're like, dude, you're going to get your ass <br />kicked!" <p />  So.... <p /> Rambls: lol <p />  oh god <p /> Me: I point at the dude enthusiastically and give him that <br />shit-eating-grin-look, and he points back and does the same. Then I <br />run up to him with my hand raised and a big grin on my face <br />and I yell, "You're such a a douchebag!" And he is smiling at me, hand <br />raised, no idea what's going on..&hellip; My hand <br />misses his and hits him on the arm. He starts laughing, <br />points to me and says, "You're the worst douchebag ever!" And I grin, <br />point back, and say, "And you're the best!" Everyone was dying.</p>
