Every time Skype releases an update for the Mac, a glimmer of hope wells up in me. Could this be the version in which we finally get back the wonderful Skype 2.x OS X interface?

Alas, disappointment dawns as not only are we greeted with the awful, I-would-fire-the-designers-in-a-heartbeat Skype 5 interface that, unfortunately, Windows users have had to endure for even longer than we Mac users, but the UI/UX has been made worse, cluttered with features that take away from the joy of making a simple, high-quality call over the Internet.

"Man-in-the-middleware" at its finest.
