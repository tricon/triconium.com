<p>EXCLUSIVE: Fresh off Disney's massive success with Tim Burton's "Alice in Wonderland," Warner Bros. wants to remake another childhood classic. Like, really classic.</p>
<p>The studio is examining two existing "Wizard of Oz" projects, with an eye toward giving one of them a modern gloss and moving it toward the screen.</p>

<p>This is incredibly irritating. Disney, don't touch such a classic. We're living in an era of remakes -- some good, most bad. Leave this one alone.</p>
