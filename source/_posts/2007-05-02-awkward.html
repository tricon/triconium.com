Today was one of the most awkward days of my life.

This was the third time I've had a conversation like this in the past four years. The strange thing is: I have seen this day coming, only I didn't know what the catalyst would be. I wonder if I have truly been given a powerful mind that is deeply tapped into The Secret, and that I have "imagined" this event into existence.

If people want to know my feelings, they can read this blog. Ever think that perhaps I write better than I talk? That it's a bit less awkward for me to write when I want to than to be coerced into talking?

I find it a little ironic that just before this, I had been wanting to take a vow of silence for a week. Unfortunately, my daily work prevents this.

Because of this, things will change....

I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing.

I'm entitled to my own secrets.

I'm not like everyone else.

I wish someone would understand that...
