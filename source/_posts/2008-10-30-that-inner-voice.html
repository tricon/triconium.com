There's something that speaks to all of us. It lies within us, that inner voice. Some call it ego, others call it God. It matters not what you call it -- you must acknowledge it.

To hear this inner voice, sometimes you must shroud yourself from external influences. Use these external influences for inspiration and reflection, but do not let them guide you. It is only this inner voice that knows what you truly want. When you nourish this inner voice, the distractions and envy of those and the world around you begin to fade; what emerges -- an individual embraced with identity, able to give back to those who inspired them to aspire.

I have been a ghost in a shell. This shell of blood, this shell of flesh, I have held ambitions, aspirations, and dreams; yet like a ghost, I have remained hollow and transparent. Others have seen this in me. Others have seen my untapped potential and have prodded me to take up my mantle, lighting my own path.

That light I have known not.

                                            Until now.

I greet you with open arms as a new man. A new perspective I have embraced, transforming me in ways I have only dreamt of. A new identity forged from trials and tribulations so mentally aggressive that I have considered changing my name to reflect my new found being.

Where before I walked in the shade of others, I now cast my own shadow. The darkness knows itself intimately. Hiding in darkness out of fear and frailty can not produce a shroud of influence to blanket those around you. You must stand in the light to cast your shadow.
