Have you ever been to Cnet.com and noticed the Flash map on the right hand side as you are reading an article? This map allows you to see how events and articles are related to each other. While Cnet has had this feature for some time, I took the time to check out the Flash map's creator: LivePlasma.com.

LivePlasma.com is currently a beta service that allows you to see networks of your favorite movies and music, spanning artists and directors. Click a director's name and you can see their movies and other related works of art. Add a title to your favorites and LivePlasma will generate your own network map for you.

Since it's only a beta, you are limited to how many titles you can add to your favorites. However, this could prove to be a next-gen visual method for finding additional movies and music that cater to your tastes.
