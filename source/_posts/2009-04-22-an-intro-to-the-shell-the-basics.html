title: "An Intro to the Shell: The Basics"
published: true

I am a diehard Linux and Mac enthusiast. One of the key reasons for this is the shell environment that both operating systems share. A powerful shell is key to any quality operating system and allows you to perform actions that can be considerably more power than a GUI.

Recently, a friend of mine asked how he could get started in learning the shell. As the shell can initially appear a bit intimidating, I  decided to put together an introduction to the shell.

<br />
<strong>Getting Started</strong>

Entering the shell from a desktop environment is as easy as opening Terminal in OS X (/Applications/Utilities) or opening GnomeTerminal or Konsole in Linux (sorry Windows users. Windows has a completely worthless shell. You do have an option, though: install Cygwin. Details in the foot notes).

Upon opening your terminal application, you will be greeted with a command prompt.

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Wraith:~ tricon$</blockquote>

Typically this prompt will consist of your computer name, current directory, user name, and end with a "$". This "$" shows that you are logged in as a user (more on this later). Note that in this case my current directory is displayed as <b>~</b>. <b>~</b> means "home directory" or "user directory", and is where files pertaining to your user account are located.

<br />
<b>ls</b>

The first command to learn is one you will use frequently: <strong>ls</strong>. Type this now and hit return.

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>Wraith:~ tricon$  ls
Complete                Documents                Library                        Pictures                StoryMill Backups        Zinio Library                organize
Desktop                         Downloads                Movies                        Public                        Web Sync                autopar.rb                wo_conduit.sh
Development                Icon?                        Music                        Sites                        WebServer                dwhelper
Wraith:~ tricon$</pre></div>
</div>


<strong>ls</strong> is short for "list". This command lists all files in the current directory.

Most commands have options. These options adjust the way a command operates or what it operates on.

A useful option for the <strong>ls</strong> command is <strong>-a</strong>. Note that <strong>-</strong> typically denotes that you are issuing options to the command in order to differentiate from a parameter. These parameters can be additional input, a file, or another form of input that the command requires (more on parameters later).

Before you re-run <strong>ls</strong> with the <strong>-a</strong> option, I'm going to teach you a very useful trick. Hit the <strong>up arrow</strong> on your keyboard. This will bring back the last command you typed. In fact, you can keep hitting the <strong>up arrow</strong> to cycle through your past commands. 

Hit the up arrow and append <strong>-a</strong> to the <strong>ls</strong> command.

<strong>ls -a</strong> lists all files in the current directory, including hidden ones. Files beginning with a period are considered hidden.

Now type: <strong>ls -l</strong>

This lists files vertically, showing their attributes (more on this later).

Here we provided two options to <b>ls</b>: <b>-a</b> and <b>-l</b>. With most commands you can append them behind a single <b>-</b>.

Notice that when using <b>-a</b> with the <b>ls</b> command there are two odd looking entries: <b>.</b> and <b>..</b><br />
<b>.</b> refers to the current directory that you are in while <b>..</b> refers to the parent directory -- the one above the current directory. These are very useful and lead us into the next command.

<br />
<b>cd</b>

<b>cd</b> stands for "change directory". This allows you to move between directories in the shell.

Type: <b>cd ..</b>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>Wraith:~ tricon$ cd ..
Wraith:Users tricon$</pre></div>
</div>


<b>cd ..</b> means "change to directory .." Since <b>..</b> refers to the parent directory, you just went up a directory in the shell.
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>Wraith:Users tricon$ ls
Shared        tricon</pre></div>
</div>


We are now in the directory for user accounts (/Users/ in OS X; /home/ in Linux). You should see your username in this listing. Here's a neat trick. Type: <b>cd</b> followed by a letter or two of your username and hit the <b>tab</b> key. Your username was just auto-completed.

Auto-completion is a huge time saver. At any point while you are typing part of a path, you can hit <b>tab</b> to auto-complete the part of the path you are typing. But what happens when there are multiple possibilities? Hitting <strong>tab</strong> the first time will do nothing on the command line (thought it will typically make a beeping noise). Hitting <b>tab</b> again will list the possibilities. In order for <b>tab</b> to auto-complete, you need to type enough characters so that the possibilities are narrowed down to one, at which point hitting <b>tab</b> will auto-complete.

You've just learned two very common and important commands. This next command is one of the most important as it will allow you to learn how to use virtually any command.

<br />
<b>man</b>

<b>man</b> is short for "manual". This command will display the manual, or "man page", for virtually any command. Type: <b>man ls</b>.

You will be shown a window with all of the details you could ever want to know about the <b>ls</b> command. Within this screen you can use the arrow keys to navigate. Hit <b>q</b> to "quit" and return back to the command prompt.

<br />
<b>Homework</b>

For your homework, practice changing directories and listing their contents. For bonus points, practice using some of the available options listed in the man page for each command.

<br />
<b>Final Notes</b>

You have begun your journey to learn one of the most powerful ways to interact with a computer: the command line. While these two commands may not seem like much, they are building blocks for a shell that features hundreds of commands. These copious commands allow you to do virtually anything, from mass renaming files to looking under the hood of your operating system, automating tasks, and beyond.

In part two we'll cover more commands, show you how to manage files from the shell, and explain what attributes are and why they are important.

<br />
<strong>Cygwin</strong>

For you Windows users out there, there is hope! Cygwin is a Linux shell environment for Windows. Upon installing this, you will be able to launch a program from your Start Menu that will provide you with a shell nearly identical to the ones available in OS X and Linux.

Cygwin can be found here: <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>
