OpenID is a great way to simplify the authentication and registration process. Using SSL, you can make authentication even easier by no longer requiring a password to login.

If you use <a href="http://myopenid.com">MyOpenID.com</a> as your OpenID provider, login at <a href="http://myopenid.com">MyOpenID.com</a>, go to "Account Settings", then "Authentication Settings". Under "Add an SSL Client Certificate", enter a name for the computer your on and click, "Create Certificate". This will install a SSL certificate in your browser that will automatically identify you when visiting <a href="http://myopenid.com">MyOpenID.com</a>.

A word of advise, do not use this method on a public or shared computer. Anyone that has access to your computer will have access to your <a href="http://myopenid.com">MyOpenID.com</a> account.
