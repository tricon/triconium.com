> In a comment, John refers to the idea of the “allow access to the address book?” dialog box option as “security theater,” and it is—to the same degree the one for location services is. In both cases, it’s telling you something you probably should have known already (“what do you mean the Yelp app needs location services to figure out what businesses are around me?”), and none of us have any blessed idea what data any of those apps are sending back to their servers even with those dialog boxes.

Good designers use dialogue boxes minimally, yet sometimes we are forced to implement "checkpoints" for reasons none other than passing the buck. "You chose to give us your information!"

This isn't to say that there aren't valid reasons for having these checkpoints, but as explained above, they don't tell us what is being done with that information. The answer to this is developer responsibility. Developers need to create a bond of trust with their users by crafting solutions that take their user's emotions and respect into account. They need to realize the threat of breaking this trust, understanding the risks of alienating their user base. This threat of abandonment, in turn, is the check-and-balance provided by the user.

Inundating the user with "policies" is not the answer.
