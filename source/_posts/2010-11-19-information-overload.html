<p>Yesterday I felt stressed and cluttered because my Instapaper and starred items in Google Reader only seemed to ever increase. I decided I would tackle nearly two years of news articles in an effort to get to zero upon which I would develop habits for clearing them regularly. I spent literally all day on this, and in doing so, I felt additional stress as if I had to rush to get through it all. This only distracted me from being present with the information at hand.</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>I couldn't do it. I couldn't possibly get through them all. After hours I still had over 90 pages of articles in Instapaper and over 600 starred items in Google Reader. I had to make a choice.</p>
<p>I declared news bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I have chosen to become a seeker of information rather than a hoarder. I have decided to value my time and my thoughts first. I have decided to become a curator of my mind, saving only the information that is most useful and precious. The rest can be sought after when necessary.</p>
<p>I encourage you to do the same.</p>
