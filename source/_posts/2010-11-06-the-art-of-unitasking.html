<p>It used to be that your operating system effectively only let you run a single application at a time. Since computers weren't very fast, users would have to shut down an application and wait for the next application to launch before they could resume their work. This was not effective.</p>
<p>Eventually the evolution of hardware and software brought about the oh-so-coveted multitasking. Great! Now people could run dozens of applications and switch between them on a whim. Even better, users could view two applications side by side or watch a movie while they worked; because, you know, humans are incredibly efficient machines and can look in two directions at once.</p>
<p>Sarcasm aside, multitasking has enabled us to accomplish more while allowing us to accomplish less. The problem is that our brains only multitask on certain levels. Cognitively, our brains more-so Fast Context Switch, which is akin to the Fast Application Switching that occurs on mobile devices today. Just as there is overhead when computers switch contexts, there is overhead when your brain does so as well. Have you ever experienced a sudden lack of awareness, like you needed to get your bearings, when switching from one application to the next? Your brain has changed state and it must now process all the new information that it has aggregated.</p>
<p>Multitasking is effective when actions are orderly chained: you just finished a web design mockup in Photoshop so you are now switching to Fireworks to slice it, or you are switching to TextMate to implement it. Multitasking is devastating when switching between unrelated contexts: you're working in TextMate and flip over to Safari to check Twitter. Ouch! You must now order and process information all over again once you switch back to TextMate.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can get your bearings quickly, but these context switches add up over time. It's even worse when you were in deep thought, when you had concentration or were "wired in" as they say in "The Social Network", and you now have to earn that all over again -- and concentration is truly something you earn with great effort and practice.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Looking at iOS</strong></span></p>
<p>iOS is a prime example of cognitive unitasking and proper multitasking. iOS allows only certain processes to be run in the background. On a technical level this saves on resources. iOS also only allows one application to take up the screen at any given time. On a cognitive level, this encourages unitasking; and iOS has the perfect animation for switching contexts.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nxLVCe-ETRg" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p>Applications literally switch places. This gives an immediate visual cue and emotional feeling that contexts are being switched. It also gives the user a moment to prepare for the new context.</p>
<p>Compare this to the previous animation in iOS when opening a link in Safari from within another application (skip to 4:17).</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/L27yVbGrcm4#t=4m17s" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p>The current application zooms away while Safari zooms in. This creates a completely different emotional feeling, one that is far more jarring and makes the user feel less in control.</p>
<p>Regardless, iOS effectively enforces unitasking. The result is devoted attention. Consequently, switching applications is easy yet painful in that it requires additional effort to do so -- a good reason to have a workflow defined.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at Lion</span></strong></p>
<p>Apple is bringing the art of unitasking to the desktop and laptop OS in their upcoming release of OS X: Lion. While switching applications is as easy as ever, and more orderly thanks to the new Mission Control UI, Apple is encouraging applications to have a fullscreen mode, providing a native API for doing so. The result is this:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bEeGJkp1wt4" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p>Easy. Organic.</p>
<p>Fullscreen modes allow the user interface to be reorganized in a completely different way, focusing the user on the given application and the tasks at hand. Fullscreen is undeniably powerful in its ability to encourage and enforce unitasking, and as desktops and laptops generally have larger screens than mobile devices, applications can still be laid out side by side for those moments when you need to reference one application while working within another.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Multitasking is Overrated</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">On a functional level, multitasking serves a very important purpose. On a higher level, it is adverse to productivity. Multitasking has become a buzzword in which many think it synonymous with productivity; but as Merlin Mann said in "<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/10/06/broken-meetings">Broken Meetings</a>", multitasking is something everyone says they're good at, but in practice, isn't.&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">We're seeing a trend towards a new hybrid of multitasking empowered unitasking -- multitasking done right. Forgo multitasking. Embrace unitasking. Accomplish more with less.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">P.S. Empower yourself. The ability to produce and deliver isn't resolved by unitasking at a technical level.&nbsp;<a href="http://zenhabits.net/">Learn to focus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.themindfulist.com/">become mindful</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/">discover new techniques</a>.</span></strong></span></p>
