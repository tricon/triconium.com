I recently purchased Apple&rsquo;s Magic Trackpad off of a friend (thanks, Jeff), and I have come to love it. Not only do I find trackpads more accurate and direct than mice, a third party tool has allowed me to replicate all of the functionality of my MX Revolution and more.  The app: <a href="http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=1722">BetterTouchTool</a>

BetterTouchTool allows you to remap the gestures of the touchpad to virtually anything you wish. Want to remap four finger swipe down? No problem. Pinch to zoom? Yep. Not only can you remap these gestures globally, you can remap them on a per-application basis. This allows you to create uniformity across your apps. Just as a three finger swipe left and right allows you to go back and forth between folders in Finder, the same gesture can be applied to iTunes to navigate tracks.

BetterTouchTool also provides a number of gestures that aren&rsquo;t directly supported by Apple: five finger gestures, tiptap gestures, complete thumb cancellation, and more.  BetterTouchTool isn&rsquo;t only limited to the Magic Trackpad, however. It can also be used with the Magic Mouse as well as the trackpad built in on your MacBook, providing it has multitouch support. In addition, it offers advanced controls and experimental features for perfecting your input methods.

<strong>Do note</strong>: BetterTouchTool is still in development and far from complete. Some gestures don&rsquo;t pick up every time which is frustrating. Regardless, it still proves useful for extending the capabilities of your multitouch peripheral and will only get better in time.</p>

<p>If you utilize multitouch peripherals, this is a no brainer. <a href="http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=1722">Download BetterTouchTool now</a>.</p>
