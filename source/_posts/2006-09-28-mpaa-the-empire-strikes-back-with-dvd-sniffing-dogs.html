Some things corporations do these days may make you roll your eyes. But then there are those that make you wonder if the executives within these companies graduated from a public school at the bottom of their class. Take the newest news, for instance, that the MPAA has acquired two dogs for the purpose of sniffing packages for burned DVDs. My dealer never told me there was a difference in scent. Next time I go buy DVDs from my dealer for the purpose of sniffing, I'll be sure to point out how he's been selling me the cheap stuff.

I bet Rin Tin Tin is rolling over in his grave.
