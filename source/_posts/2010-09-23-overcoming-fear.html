<p>From <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ThinkSimple/~3/XpM8skdMNDk/">Overcoming Fear</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>The caveat is that sometimes when we change, it will make some people around us uncomfortable. When I decided to change, I had lost many friends. Some of my relatives disowned me and others stopped talking to me.</p>

<p>The loss of friends and relatives was very painful but the rewards were truly worthwhile. I made new friends who ended up becoming more like family than friends. I went from being a miserable person to being a happy person. The void disappeared. My life went from being meaningless to meaningful. It was the wisest decision I ever made in my life.</p></blockquote>
