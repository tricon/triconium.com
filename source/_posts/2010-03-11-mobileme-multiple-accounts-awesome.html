<div style="margin-top: 0px !important; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px !important; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I finally have an email setup that I am absolutely thrilled with.</div>
<p style="margin-top: 18px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I was quickly growing tired of the way Gmail handles IMAP, and having to create a new email address for every client whose business I became an active participant in was becoming unmanageable.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 18px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The solution: Mail.app lets you alias as other addresses. There is a caveat. You can't actually send the mail as that address unless you setup an SMTP server for Mail.app to send through for that address, but Mail.app will set the from field to that address for you. This combined with forwarding from all of my other addresses allows me to leverage the beauty of MobileMe's web apps, Mail.app, iCal.app, and even QuickBooks' ability to assign dates and to-dos on an iCal calendar. No longer do I have to deal with the headaches of each IMAP mail account creating its own to-do calendar. I can also now see all of my calendars in MobileMe web.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 18px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Sigh of relief.</p>
