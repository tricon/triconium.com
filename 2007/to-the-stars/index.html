	<div class="entry-content">I can&#8217;t believe the timing of things. As I just finished my last post, &#8220;Waiting For My Real Life To Begin&#8221; by Colin Hay came on. It is playing as I write this very entry, and it is speaking to my heart in ways that could only be construed by God Himself. These are the lyrics:

<blockquote>
Any minute now, my ship is coming in 
I&#8217;ll keep checking the horizon 
I&#8217;ll stand on the bow, feel the waves come crashing 
Come crashing down down down, on me 

And you say, be still my love 
Open up your heart 
Let the light shine in 
But don&#8217;t you understand 
I already have a plan 
I&#8217;m waiting for my real life to begin 

When I awoke today, suddenly nothing happened 
But in my dreams, I slew the dragon 
And down this beaten path, and up this cobbled lane 
I&#8217;m walking in my old footsteps, once again 
And you say, just be here now 
Forget about the past, your mask is wearing thin 
Let me throw one more dice 
I know that I can win 
I&#8217;m waiting for my real life to begin 

Any minute now, my ship is coming in 
I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll keep checking the horizon 
And I&#8217;ll check my machine, there&#8217;s sure to be that call 
It&#8217;s gonna happen soon, soon, soon 
It&#8217;s just that times are lean 

And you say, be still my love 
Open up your heart, let the light shine in 
Don&#8217;t you understand 
I already have a plan 
I&#8217;m waiting for my real life to begin
</blockquote>

Sometimes it would be easier to cry, but I can&#8217;t. I feel like I&#8217;m in love, but I don&#8217;t know why, with whom, or with what. It&#8217;s not an emptiness; I have filled that with God. It&#8217;s a lack of direction. I&#8217;m in love with a woman that I don&#8217;t know exists, yet at the same time I don&#8217;t know what I want. I&#8217;m indecisive, and fear committing to a choice. I&#8217;m afraid of failure.

I need someone to be here now. I need to take off my frail mask. I need my life to begin.

Out of all of my friends and co-workers, I feel I am the most misunderstood. Part of this stems from my inability to express myself properly, and part of this stems form the emotional, hopeless romantic part of me that I have put in a cage all of these years. A part of me I feel is unique to me, and is a part of me that I love. The thing is, this part of me is not a small piece of me, it&#8217;s a majority of me, and yet it lies dormant, waiting to be set free.

I don&#8217;t mind being single. Since my first relationship years ago, I have come to appreciate being single. Feeling lonely isn&#8217;t regularly a part of me, but when I lay my head on my pillow at night, sometime the loneliness really sinks in. I&#8217;m not the kind of person to rush into the arms of someone to escape the feeling of being lonely. I&#8217;m a hopeless romantic, and as such I long to fall in love and pour my heart out to someone. As consequence, I am picky.

I also am not the kind to &#8220;look&#8221; for opportunities, I await them. I guess you could argue that I believe in some sort of fairy-tale love, or love at first site. Call it what you will, I await meeting that one person that I feel a connection to. A connection that I can&#8217;t explain but know so well as it is a part of me. Then again, maybe convincing myself that I&#8217;m waiting is my way of giving myself hope.

I&#8217;m going to go drive out to the country, listen to Colin Hay, and stare at the stars.
