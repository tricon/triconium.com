As I write this, I am listening to an artist I just got into today. The artist is Colin Hay, former front-man for the 80&#8217;s band, Men at Work. His music is soulful, emotional, and inspiring. As I listened to &#8220;Beautiful World&#8221; I closed my eyes and allowed my mind to imagine the song visually. It was inspiring, reconnecting me to the emotional, vulnerable side that I try to hide so much.

A while back I talked about how I hate fa&Atilde;&sect;ades. To be honest, I still put such a thing on. If I&#8217;m around someone I don&#8217;t know, I will force my personality. Other times I try to be a hard-ass in order to be &#8220;tougher&#8221; than I appear. This isn&#8217;t who I am. Why can&#8217;t I be myself?

I&#8217;ve come to realize recently that I don&#8217;t love myself. There are things that I do love about myself, but I do not love myself completely. In addition I shun the love of others, perhaps even the love of God. I want to be something that I&#8217;m not.

Some episodes of Scrubs I have watched recently have addressed this and have been quite inspiring in my life. Especially memorable is a moment in which Dr. Cox tells Dr. Reid to be herself. That she would be better off is she didn&#8217;t worry so much about what people thought of her. I worry so much about what people think about me. I fear the judgment of man, and I look for ways to validate myself. Perhaps this is what has kept me from being truly passionate about something.

I&#8217;m a passionate person &#8211; indirectly. What I mean is that I feel a lot of passion in my heart, in my soul, but I have no where to direct it. In terms of careers, I can&#8217;t remember a single task or subject that I was ever excited or passionate about. This brings into question the current direction of my future.

Maybe I just need some away-time, away from the distractions of everyday life&#8230;and maybe I long for something that doesn&#8217;t exist.

All I know is that I will wake up tomorrow and go through another routine day, letting another moment of my life waste away. Life is too short to idle. If only I knew where to direct my passion.
