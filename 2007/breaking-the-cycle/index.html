	<div class="entry-content">Today was a sad day for me. I called a very good friend of mine only to find out that he just moved to Kansas yesterday. I was going to call him on Friday to hang out with him, but I ended up going to see &#8220;Grindhouse&#8221; instead. I had no idea he was planning to move to Kansas and it sounds like the decision was pretty sudden.

The good news is that I am hoping to go visit him in the summer. We talked about how we really want to take a trip together to California to hang out as we are both quite fond of the state. We also seem to be going through a very similar situation in life &#8211; what are we passionate about? Nevertheless, I am going to miss him immensely, but we both have agreed to stay in touch and to seriously make plans for the trip.

Tonight Rob and I finished season two of &#8220;Scrubs&#8221; and are almost half way through the third season. More memories to add, both of &#8220;Scrubs&#8221; itself and of watching them with Rob. There are so many beautiful, touching, and hilarious moments in &#8220;Scrubs,&#8221; and Rob and I have become so attached to the characters that we often quote, discuss, and relate to them. Scrubs and it&#8217;s cast and crew deserve Emmy after Emmy.

I called my brother today to express my sadness in Mark moving, but I could not reach him. What is interesting is how in an episode of &#8220;Scrubs&#8221; that I watched tonight, Dan, J.D.&#8217;s older brother, stood up for J.D. even after J.D. said some very damaging things to him. It was a reminder to put our differences aside with our siblings, and to love them no matter what. I relate to this because it has become hard to talk to my brother due to our strong differences in spiritual beliefs. I just need to let go and love.

Sometimes I wonder if I have seen the future, better yet, a glimpse of it. I know Rob has, but perhaps I lack the faith to truly believe that something I have seen in my mind is that of the future. I often write it off as being conjured up by my own imagination, and considering my over-active imagination, it very well could be. I guess I will know it when I see it, though it will be after-the-fact. Hindsight is 20/20.
