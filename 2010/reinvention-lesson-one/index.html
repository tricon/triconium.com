	<div class="entry-content"><p>What does it take to reinvent oneself? <p /> Take a look at who you were five years ago. Take a look at yourself today. See a difference? I certainly hope so. <strong>Reflection is an important part of reinvention and personal evolution.</strong> <p /> Now, close your eyes and imagine the person you&#8217;d like to be. This is likely a mashup of changes inspired by your experiences seasoned with concepts borrowed from heroes and idols. This is your future projection of yourself. <p /> Reflecting on the past you and current you, are you closer to your future self? How do you begin this change, or how do you continue it more efficiently? <p /> <strong>JOURNAL</strong> <p /> Wether you prefer writing or speaking, record your thoughts frequently. Start by journaling a few times a week. Work on increasing the frequency to daily. Why? Journaling gives you a change to think about your choices throughout the day more analytically. It helps you see and make sense of things. It allows you to track your progress, to see where you have failed and where you have succeeded. By journaling, you train yourself to be more self-observant. <strong>This enhances your ability to analyze situations so that you can begin to apply this skill to real-time self observation.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Homework: Your homework for the next three weeks is to journal at least three times a week. Think about your day, what happened, how you responded, how you could have responded more appropriately. Ask yourself tough, detailed questions.<strong> Admit to failures. Appreciate your successes</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Final Notes: <strong>Our future selves are who we are meant to be.</strong> It is important that your future self be not a mirror of a hero or an idol but a better version of yourself enhanced with the best attributes of what your heroes and idols have to offer. Long-term change requires constant reflection and persistence. Who you are is determined by the choices you make. Observe yourself so that you may make the right choices. <strong>Be not a product of your environment but a crafting of your own design.</strong></p>
