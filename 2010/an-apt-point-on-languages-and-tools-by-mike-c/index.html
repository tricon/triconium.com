	<div class="entry-content"><p>In response to <a href="http://seldo.com/weblog/2010/09/27/php_needs_to_die_what_will_replace_it">this article</a>, Mike C in the comments writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mike C</p>

<p>In the phrase &ldquo;I want a language that assumes everything I will be building is an MVC web app, and builds that right into the core language, not just a library&rdquo; you&rsquo;re missing a key ingredient: the IDE. For those of you who have never used MIcrosoft&rsquo;s Visual Studio for writing an ASP.NET MVC application, the amount of work that the IDE does for you is incredible. While you <em>could</em> all of the files needed for a web app in Notepad (or gEdit, if you&rsquo;re into that) the amount of code you would need to write is considerable &mdash; it&rsquo;s precisely the kind of &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; crap that should be handled for you by the developing environment.</p>

<p>In addition to handling a lot of the coding work for you (but certainly not &ldquo;magic coding&rdquo;) it&rsquo;s important to not overlook the ability to debug an application in the IDE. When writing .NET code I can walk line-by-line through a running application, looking at variable values. In PHP I have to do something like &ldquo;echo $var; end;&rdquo; and keep moving that &ldquo;debug in the browser&rdquo; echo statement until I find the problem.</p>

<p>I like the idea of having a language specifically created for the purpose of making a web application, but without a holistic view &mdash; web server/mod, web framework, language, IDE, storage/model extensibility, client-side technology/jQuery &mdash; this whole conversation is pretty much meaningless.</p>

<p>And the biggest point the author is missing: HTML5 is the next revolution that will radically change the way we write the server-side code of our web apps.</p></blockquote>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve grown up with general purpose editors such as VIM, Emacs, and TextMate, I have come to appreciate the heavy lifting and <strong>perspective</strong> an IDE can provide.  Take Xcode for example. It is certainly not without its flaws, but the boilerplate code it generates, the easy debugging, the code sense, and its other workflow-improving features, make developing Objective-C apps considerably easier than in an editor such as TextMate. (I certainly do love TextMate, though, and wish I could somehow embed it within Xcode &mdash; best of both worlds.)</p>

<p>It is these productivity enhancements that have made me yearn for a quality, native IDE for Rails development. NetBeans is the best I&rsquo;ve found in terms of UI, but it still suffers from non-native UI elements that are a pain to use as well as slow, clunkiness in general.</p>

<p>Choosing an IDE or editor is certainly a matter of taste, but once applications grow beyond a certain size, it seems IDEs really begin to show their value and almost become a necessity.</p>

<p>Where do you stand? IDE or editor?</p>
