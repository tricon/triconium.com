<p>I&#8217;ve spent the last hour or so trying to determine an ideal solution for syncing RSS feeds between the iPad and Mac. Unfortunately, they&#8217;re aren&#8217;t a lot of good solutions. <p /> That&#8217;s okay. Upon reflection, I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;ve become obsessed with syncing, having my data with me at all times. Yet is this really that important? <p /> I use MobileMe to remotely access files when needed. This has worked well, and I have been unable to connect to my home Mac on only a few occasions. These few hiccups have never been a show-stopper. Previously I took this obsession further, putting all of my company files on iDisk in case I needed them. This only took up valuable space and caused syncing headaches. Task management: same story. Now it&#8217;s RSS. <p /> I worry too much over future-proofing my solutions &#8220;just in case.&#8221; Yet any time something hasn&#8217;t worked out, I&#8217;ve been fine. My new perspective is domain specific: utilize each device for what it does best. Do I really need to track my location in a book so that I can resume reading it on the computer? No. Do I really need to have all of my feeds and read states synced across my iMac, MacBook Air, and iPad? No. Sure, it&#8217;s convenient, but the overhead isn&#8217;t worth it. Where syncing is useful is with email, but email is a general purpose task in which we have standards such as IMAP to provide syncing solutions. <p /> To attempt to have the same experience on every platform voids the given platforms of their unique expressions. Taking advantage of a platform&#8217;s unique abilities is something I have preached fervently, yet I now catch myself disobeying it. <p /> No more. <p /> I am now using the iPad as my primary source for reading books, feeds, and for its unique multitouch capabilities and applications. I believe that the iPad has opened up a new age in computing. We&#8217;re just seeing the tip of the iceberg, and apps like iBooks and Pulse on the iPad completely replace their computer counterparts with a much better experience. If I&#8217;m not near my iPad to read feeds or books, tough. I&#8217;ll find something else to do. Besides, do I really need to read a feed as soon as it&#8217;s updated, from anywhere at anytime? <p /> I think not.</p>
