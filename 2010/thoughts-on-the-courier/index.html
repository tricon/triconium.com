<p>Microsoft employs some very bright people in their labs. These people come up with very clever solutions such as Photosynth, Seadragon, Surface; however, the implementation of these solutions and Microsoft&#8217;s overall vision tends to lack even as these fantastic concepts are implemented. This video is also incredibly pre-emptive. Anyone could create the same stunning animation in After Effects. It doesn&#8217;t mean the product will &#8220;feel&#8221; right.<p /> For example, when the user clips a section of the document by dragging, how does it know what to drag? This is an important usability concern.<span class="text_exposed_show" style="display: inline;"><p />Apple spends more time on usability than anyone. Every little detail must feel right. It&#8217;s what leads them to create such incredible solutions. Apple may have very well had some of these same concepts in place, and they may even be planning to implement them, but they know that it is much wiser to only show something upon completion rather than to over promise and under deliver.<p /> Apple definitely has to respond in some way, whether internally or externally, to these concepts. Is it better to have a smaller, foldable profile or one large display? MS has cleverly used the dividing bezel as a pocket &#8211; very cool &#8211; however, movies and media will not be as enjoyable on the Courier. Have you seen the new digital version of Wired for the iPad? It looks and &#8220;feels&#8221; incredible on such a large display. Wired will have to format around the dividing displays of the Courier, which I don&#8217;t think will turn out as presentable. Also, the dividing bezel is a bit of a barrier when it comes to using such tablets as input devices to computers. It&#8217;s also a barrier for games; not completely as games could take a Nintendo DS approach, but the unified, large display of the iPad is far more flexible. I also can&#8217;t help but feel a disconnect when I have to look from one display to the next. Such a dividing bezel helps with organization but hinders presentation.<p /> Ultimately, the cool thing about the Courier is the use of the pen. I think Apple is taking a wise approach in going with the &#8220;tactile&#8221; feel of the hands. However, someone, hopefully Apple, must release a pressure and tilt sensitive pen for the iPad. This is crucial for artists, entrepreneurs, students, virtually everyone. As Luke and I have discussed, such a pen could easily be made for the iPad&#8217;s existing technology by syncing the pen to the iPad over Bluetooth. Apple may choose to leave such Courier-like functionality and hardware to 3rd party app-makers and hardware vendors, which would be fine. Stylists for the iPhone/iPad already exist, but someone _has_ to make a pressure and tilt sensitive Bluetooth pen available for the iPad.<p /> Regardless, if the Courier can not sync with Macs, it&#8217;s a deal-breaker for me. The iPhone would not be where it is if it were not for its ability to sync with Windows. Also, as a developer, let me tell you that developing applications for Windows is really burdensome for many reasons that I will not go into here. Unless MS cleans up its development/API ecosphere for this solution, I don&#8217;t anticipate Courier development being as inviting as iPhone/iPad development.</span></p>
