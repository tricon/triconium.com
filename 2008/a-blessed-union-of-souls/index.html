	<div class="entry-content">Heather Salm and Micah Boyce were married yesterday. I must say, it was one of the coolest wedding I have ever been to. Not only was it imbued with joy and happiness, but it featured such incredible music. Never have I seen so many talented musicians perform in a single wedding. I truly wish the best for Heather and Micah.

On a more humorous note, Luke gave the funniest speech that I&#8217;ve ever heard at a wedding. You really have to hear it for yourself to fully appreciate it. That man can write&#8230; and I&#8217;m jealous! I really need to write more. I truly am my own worst enemy.

I got to hang out with my hopefully-future-roommate, Matt, at the wedding. That man is 110% awesome and then some. I&#8217;ve been scoping for apartments as I think it will be much easier if my roommates and I all move out at the same time, otherwise there&#8217;s issues with the deposit that I&#8217;d rather not deal with. I&#8217;m hoping we can check some apartments out very soon &#8211; maybe this week.

I have a meeting with Josh tomorrow at 6:15 AM! I&#8217;m using him as my alarm clock so that I can get my body back on a sleep schedule. We&#8217;re going to go over a web site concept that he has been working on, and I&#8217;m going to apprentice him in the art of web design and development. He definitely has the mind for it, and I really hope he sticks with it.

I love Sam Yergler &#8211; I really do. Lately he has really been an inspiration and encouragement to me, let alone a source of some of the funniest stories I have ever heard. He is so easy to talk to and so understanding as well. I have never felt judged by him. I think we all could learn a lesson in selflessness and encouragement from him, and I hope that we remain friends for the rest of our lives.

This week is a week of finishing up projects. With the company restructure hopefully getting full approval this week, I&#8217;m hoping to be in a position to contract and hire more freelancers so that I can begin to focus on animation &#8211; more specifically writing our first animation. I have a concept that I am very excited about, and I can&#8217;t wait to reveal it in due time.

Alas, I must go and do my daily workout for The PCP. I&#8217;ve made a lot of progress, and I&#8217;m becoming more and more excited as I see the results. By all means, please feel free to offer words of encouragement! I sure could use them as it&#8217;s only going to get harder.
