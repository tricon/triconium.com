<strong>My Company</strong>

While it hasn&#8217;t been officially approved, my company and I are looking to restructure so that the company is more expandable and profitable. It&#8217;s a delicate task, but I feel that it is important. With our current direction, we&#8217;re going to be tied down to living from paycheck to paycheck with no room to expand. Our new direction allows us to function like a real company with assets and eventually employees.

<strong>My Blog</strong>

I love to write, I really do; but what keeps me from blogging more is a lack of discipline. For some time I have been indecisive as to what direction to take this blog in. I have decided that &#8220;Essence&#8221; will be my forum for my thoughts and musings. It&#8217;s win-win &#8211; it&#8217;s therapeutic, and if someone can take something away from it, then so much the better.

<strong>My Life</strong>

For several years I have battled having a lack of energy. I am on the road to recovery. The first major wave of energy came when I went Pescetarian the first week of the year. After about three weeks, my energy levels were considerably higher. The second wave came shortly after I started <a href="http://peakconditionproject.blogspot.com">The Peak Condition Project</a> with Chen, Patrick, Corry, and Sean. I&#8217;ve decided that it&#8217;s time to get in the best shape of my life. The Peak Condition Project is my answer.

Last year I asked a lot of hard questions, mainly those regarding life and spirituality. While I feel that I have more direction now than I did then, I&#8217;m still asking those hard questions while keeping an open mind. I&#8217;m listening to a Buddhist podcast and loving it, while at the same time retaining an open heart towards the words of men like Rob Bell. My goal is not to &#8220;craft my own religion,&#8221; but to find truth. 

For some time I made the excuse that I did not have time for a relationship. I&#8217;ve realized that my life is only going to get busier, and that if it&#8217;s important to me to have a relationship, I must sacrifice the time. It&#8217;s worth it; it&#8217;s important. I have some prospects, and I&#8217;m keeping my options open.

My roommates will be moving out in August. I adore them, but it&#8217;s time for them to have their own place separate of me. I&#8217;m looking to move in with my good friend&#8217;s Matt and Nathan. I adore these guys, and we would have a lot of fun living together. We may take over the lease where I am right now, and we may find a new place. It&#8217;s up in the air.

I&#8217;m going through big changes in my life, but I&#8217;m excited. I&#8217;ve had a good life, and it&#8217;s getting better all the time. Here&#8217;s to a very bright future.
