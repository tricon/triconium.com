	<h1 class="title">Micah's Bachelor Party and Life After the PCP</h1>
	<div class="entry-content">Micah&#8217;s bachelor party was last night, and it was a lot of fun. I almost didn&#8217;t go because I had been physically feeling up and down prior, but I was feeling better so I went.

Everyone else played Halo 3, drank, and ate junk food. I wasn&#8217;t interested in playing Halo 3, though I did play half a game with Luke, and I couldn&#8217;t drink or eat any of the food there as I am on a very strict diet. When we had a toast to Micah for his new, exciting future with Heather, I really appreciated how Luke respected the fact that I was on a strict diet and couldn&#8217;t partake in the drinking. It really helps to have friends that encourage you instead of pressure you &#8211; especially when it comes to long-term, life changing decisions such as diet and exercise.

I talked with Patrick today about life after the PCP. We both plan on easing up on our diets once winter rolls around, then resuming them in the Spring and Summer. This allows us to enjoy some of the more &#8220;guilty pleasures&#8221; of life in the Winter while retaining peak condition in the Spring and Summer.

I&#8217;ll cross that bridge when I get there. I still have a long ways to go.
