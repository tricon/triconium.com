	<div class="entry-content"><strong>Beyond Belief</strong>

I&#8217;m almost done with, &#8220;The God Delusion&#8221; by Richard Dawkins, and I must say, I can&#8217;t put it down.

I&#8217;ve been questioning my beliefs a lot over the past few years. This year I began listening to a Buddhist podcast on Zen, and recently, my faith in Christianity. I went through this about a year ago but regressed to Christianity out of comfort. Here I am again, only this time I&#8217;m finding my belief in the Christian God waning.

To summarize my beliefs: I think there could be a God, I just don&#8217;t know who the fuck He is. I believe in evolution, and I&#8217;m living my life as if it&#8217;s the only one I have. Like my friend Patrick said, life is too short to waste mental power on an afterlife. If there is an afterlife, I&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised providing that the God of the Bible is not real, and I don&#8217;t find myself in Hell.

<strong>Consequence</strong>

A side effect of my waning belief in the Christian God is a waxing awareness of the present. I feel more alive &#8211; lucky to belief alive that is. This enhanced awareness of the present has affected me in both big and little ways, from a newfound drive to what I want to do with my life, to an acuteness of the senses when I&#8217;m on my motorcycle.

An additional consequence is a greater desire for time management. Life is too short. I don&#8217;t have time to fuck around. Thus, things have got to go. I&#8217;m reminded of a blog post by the lovely <a href="http://www.gwenbell.com">Gwen Bell</a> titled, &#8221;<a href="http://www.gwenbell.com/2008/03/24/if-you-cant-pitch-it-ditch-it/">If You Can&#8217;t Pitch It, Ditch It</a>&#8221;. Gwen describes a man she met that lived life by a stopwatch in order manage his time. It sounds extreme, but I get it now: life is too short to fuck around. A stopwatch was this man&#8217;s way of making efficient use of his time. This man would even evaluate his friendships, and call them off if they weren&#8217;t beneficial. While that may a bit harsh for my tastes, the point is that I need to make efficient use of my time.


Once I&#8217;ve finished &#8220;The God Delusion&#8221;, I&#8217;m going to read it through a second time and take notes. With these notes, I&#8217;ll post my thoughts as well as a full review on the book.
