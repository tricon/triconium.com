	<div class="entry-content">Writing is therapy for me. Like many who require therapy, I don&#8217;t submit to it enough. It teases me at a distance, playfully hoping that one day I will catch it, but in the mean time, remains just out of reach.

She remains just out of reach.

I see her in my mind. Shapeshifting, she confuses me. She eludes me. Do I know her? Probably not. Will I? I fear&#8230;

Nothing&#8230;. and yet everything.

Who am I, and what am I saying? My friends don&#8217;t know me. If they only knew the life I lived in the shadows. If only those who knew my life in the shadows knew of my life in the light.

I&#8217;m torn in two, woven together by the threads of sanity. But what a frail sanity that is.

Fuck you.

You know who you are. You&#8217;re reading this right now. You&#8217;re&#8230; writing this right now.

I don&#8217;t hate who I could be. I hate who I am. With every new day, I look at the past and think, &#8220;At least I&#8217;m not who I was then.&#8221; Yet a small part of me misses that old me. It&#8217;s a co-dependency &#8211; I must dismiss it.

Anyways, tomorrow will be the start of the new year. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s already 2055. According to the death calender, this will be the year of my passing. What can I claim as accomplishments in my life? Upon reflection, will I mourn my failures to invoke my dreams? Or will I rejoice with what I have done for my family, my friends, myself?

I&#8217;ll have to give this more thought &#8211; tomorrow.
